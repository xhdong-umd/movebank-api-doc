Specifically, the study examined how mobile pastoralists in the Logone Floodplain in the Far North Province of Cameroon coordinate their movements to avoid conflict and overgrazing in a land tenure system that is commonly described as open access, a situation generally regarded as leading to a tragedy of the commons. The hypothesis is that this management system is best understood as a case of complex adaptive system, in which individual decision-making, coordination of movements among pastoralists, and participation in an information sharing network result in the emergence of a complex adaptive system in which the distribution of mobile pastoralists matches that of the available grazing resources, as in an Ideal Free Distribution (IFD). Understanding how these emergent systems work is critical for the management of rangelands across West Africa, most of which have some form of open access as well as the management of other common-pool resources, including marine fisheries.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Satellite Telemetry data from Dr. Craig Ely\",,,,,true,false,15616518,,,67.8755413467294,-147.65625,\"TUSW 2008-2012 Breeding Movements\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Raw data from Long Point Waterfowl and Dr. Khristi Wilkins\",,,,,true,false,15623466,,,68.3991800434419,-125.15625,\"TUSW 1998-2003 Breeding Movements\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,15656117,,,34.2889918650375,-119.1357421875,\"USFWS California Condor Recovery Program: Legacy Data\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Defra Darwin Plus, Univeristy of Liverpool, Anguilla National Trust, RSPB\",,\"a\",,\"DEFRA Darwin plus grant\",true,false,15706394,\"Please contact louise.soanes@liv.ac.uk\",,18.2789102626961,-63.2510375976562,\"Brown Booby, Anguilla\",,,,,,,,\"Breeding Brown boobies were GPS tracked from the IBA of Dog Island Anguilla\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,15900172,,,48.9224992637583,8.4375,\"Columba livia, one Hz\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Nuijten, R. et al. 2013.

For this, scientists routinely attach units to either birds’ backs or their tails. However, inappropriate payload distribution is critical in aircraft and, since birds and planes are subject to the same laws of physics during flight, we considered aircraft aerodynamic constraints to explain flight patterns displayed by northern gannets Sula bassana equipped with (small ca. 14 g) tail- and back-mounted accelerometers and (larger ca.  30 g) tail-mounted GPS units. Tail-mounted GPS-fitted birds showed significantly higher cumulative numbers of flap-glide cycles and a higher pitch angle of the tail than accelerometer-equipped birds, indicating problems with balancing inappropriately placed weights with knock-on consequences relating to energy expenditure. These problems can be addressed by carefully choosing where to place tags on birds according to the mass of the tags and the lifestyle of the subject species.\",\"research\",true,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,111088101,,,-37.8854217545091,147.948246002197,\"OysterCatcherTRACK\",,,,,,,,\"Tracking local birdlife - Oyster Catcher\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,12311459,,,37.81,16.0,\"Calabrian Loggerhead turtles\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,13422489,\"May be used for any educational purpose \",,35.7581796231848,-78.6793184280396,\"Eastern Box Turtle Tracking, NC Wildlife \",,,,,,,,\"Tracking the movement of box turtles in a campus wood lot. \",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,17430745,,,59.1759282492714,-147.65625,\"KIMU_Test\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,11718353,,,18.1171395723485,-71.7269897460938,\"Hispaniolan Hutia\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,17877821,,,47.7760501614757,9.04470920562744,\"MPIO European Blackbird VTK 2014\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,17733041,,,31.0,35.0,\"HUJ MPIO stork env\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Thank you to Lufthansa Environmental Support\",,,,,true,false,23385802,,,54.39,12.951,\"Grus grus project MV 2014\",,,,,,,,\"Following the movements of Eurasian Cranes (Grus grus)\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,18585705,,,76.94717,30.70633,\"Redheaded Vulture Galligan, Prakash and Paudel India and Nepal\",,,,,\"RSPB Centre for Conservation Science\nRSPB, The Lodge, Sandy, Bedfordshire, SG19 2DL\",\"toby.galligan@rsdp.org.uk\",\"Toby Galligan\",\"Determining the cause of decline in the redheaded vulture in South Aisa \",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,18695469,,,26.9277757143766,92.2233581542969,\"Study movement, home range and habitat selection of Asian Elephant in Bhutan\",,,,,,,,\"This study will result in knowing the home range of Asian Elephants in Bhutan, while also knowing the choice of elevation in its habitat use   \",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"This research was conducted by the University of Tasmania and Australian Wildlife Conservancy.\",,\"McGregor H.

Available data suggests most birds nesting in the Great Basin migrate south to Mexico and to the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts (Robinson and Oring 1996).  Data are also lacking on the size of migratory groups, the speed and timing of migration, and stopover locations.  \",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,220303763,,,43.556,-116.104,\"Swainson's Hawk Synthetic Data\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,43324208,,,-34.810538469918,138.620553016663,\"Twinkletoes Test 1\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,43570149,,,32.0,35.0,\"Rotics_storks_spring_env\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Sponsored by <a href=\"\"http://www.vectronic-aerospace.com/wildlife.php\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">Vectronic Aerospace GmbH</a>\",,\"Cagnacci F, Focardi S, Hewison AJM, Morellet N, Heurich M, Stache A, Kjellander P, Linnell JDC, Mysterud A, Neteler M, Delucchi L, Ossi F, Urbano F (2011) Partial migration in roe deer: migratory and resident tactics are end points of a behavioural gradient determined by ecological factors.

Local bird conservation communities (Fûgelwachten Makkum, Warkum, Koudum-Himmelum, Stavoren-Warns) provided locations of many nests. Funding for NRS, MAV, and their fieldwork was supported by NWO-ALW TOP grant ‘Shorebirds in space’ (854.11.004) awarded to TP. Long-term godwit research was funded by the ‘Kenniskring weidevogels’ of the former Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management and Food Safety (2007-2010, 2012) and the Province of Fryslân (2013-2014), with additional financial support of the Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds (through It Fryske Gea), the Van der Hucht de Beukelaar Stichting, the Paul and Louise Cook Endowment Ltd., the University of Groningen, and BirdLife-Netherlands. We thank the citizen-group ‘Kening fan ‘e Greide’, and especially B.

Although the most informative way of investigating and interpreting collective movement phenomena would be afforded by the collection of high-resolution spatiotemporal data from moving individuals, such data are scarce and are virtually non-existent for long-distance group motion within a natural setting because of the associated technological difficulties. Here we present results of experiments in which track logs of homing pigeons flying in flocks of up to 10 individuals have been obtained by high-resolution lightweight GPS devices and analysed using a variety of correlation functions inspired by approaches common in statistical physics. We find a well-defined hierarchy among flock members from data concerning leading roles in pairwise interactions, defined on the basis of characteristic delay times between birds’ directional choices. The average spatial position of a pigeon within the flock strongly correlates with its place in the hierarchy, and birds respond more quickly to conspecifics perceived primarily through the left eye—both results revealing differential roles for birds that assume different positions with respect to flock-mates. From an evolutionary perspective, our results suggest that hierarchical organization of group flight may be more efficient than an egalitarian one, at least for those flock sizes that permit regular pairwise interactions among group members, during which leader–follower relationships are consistently manifested.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Raya Rey, A., C.A.

Over the past three years, HDR has worked with the U.S. Navy to\ncarry out vessel-based line transect visual surveys, photo-identification (photo ID) surveys, and focal\nfollow surveys with the goal of determining bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) densities and site\nfidelity as well as humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) habitat use within waters adjacent to naval\nStation Norfolk, Joint Expiditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck\nAnnex, and within and the MINEX W-50. \n\nTo establish baseline occurrence and behavior data for humpback whales in the Hampton Roads mid-Atlantic region, this study aims to address the following questions:\n• What age classes (juveniles, sub-adults, adults) are utilizing the waters within and adjacent to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay?\n• Do humpback whales exhibit site-fidelity over periods of days to years?\n• Do humpback whales congregate in specific high-traffic and/or high-use U.S. Navy training areas?\n• Do humpback whales spend significant time within or move through areas of U.S. Navy live-fire and MINEX training?\n\nHowever, relatively little information exists on how numerous offshore species, including beaked whales and endangered fin and sperm whales utilize the waters of the VACAPES OPAREA near the continental shelf break habitat.\nRecent aerial surveys by the Virginia Aquarium, University of North Carolina Wilmington, and HDR (HDR,\n2010), as well as vessel surveys by HDR, suggest that baleen whales, sperm whales, and other deep\ndiving odontocetes may be more common to the area of interest than first thought. The objectives of this\nstudy are to utilize a combination of techniques including 1) photo-ID and behavioral data collection to\nprovide baseline assessments of animal movement patterns, site-fidelity, habitat use, life-history, and\nbehavior; 2) biopsy sampling to identify individuals, determine foraging patterns, and assist in delineating\nstock structure boundaries; 3) satellite-monitored tagging techniques to supplement photo-ID-based\nstudies by providing information on residency patterns and habitat use across longer time scales (weeks\nto months).\n\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"Paul Williams, Nigel Raine, Rachael Winfree, Claire Kremen\",,\"Hagen M, Wikelski M, Kissling WD (2011) Space use of bumblebees (Bombus spp.) revealed by radio-tracking.

Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25–43.53 ha) within one or a few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e.g. trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited.

Uncovering the level of migratory connectivity is crucial for effective conservation actions and for understanding of the evolution of local adaptations and migratory routes. Here we investigate migration patterns in a passerine bird, the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, over its wide Western Palearctic breeding range using geolocators from Spain, Sweden, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Turkey. We found moderate migratory connectivity: a highly significant spatial structure in the connections between breeding and sub-Saharan non-breeding grounds, but at the same time a partial overlap between individual populations, particularly along the Gulf of Guinea where the majority of birds from the Spanish, Swedish and Czech populations spent their non-breeding period. The post-breeding migration routes were similar in direction and rather parallel for the five populations. Birds from Turkey showed the most distinctive migratory routes and sub-Saharan non-breeding range, with a post-breeding migration to East Africa and, together with birds from Bulgaria, a previously unknown pre-breeding migration over the Arabian Peninsula indicating counter-clockwise loop migration. The distances between breeding and sub-Saharan non-breeding sites, as well as between first and final sub-Saharan non-breeding sites, differed among populations. Moreover, the total speed of migration did not differ significantly between populations during both the post-breeding migration in autumn as well as during pre-breeding migration in spring. There was also no significant relationship between the total speed of migration and distance between breeding and non-breeding sites (neither post- nor pre-breeding) and, surprisingly, the total speed of migration generally did not differ significantly between post-breeding and pre-breeding migration. Future challenges include understanding whether non-breeding environmental conditions may have influenced the differences in migratory patterns that we observed between populations, and to which extent non-breeding habitat fluctuations and loss may affect population sizes of migrants.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,191714676,,,-13.9234038977233,-52.03125,\"taxon com. name pi fam. name study loc.\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,191966867,,,40.0,-75.0,\"rd surveys\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,150776913,,,-18.994284,-56.616184,\"peba nhumi clean track\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,150791002,,,-18.994284,-56.616184,\"peba nhumi clean burrow\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,221112969,,,48.346111,110.356458,\"Siberian Cranes Grus Mongolia\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,154888229,,,39.9097362345372,-75.234375,\"just trying to figure this out\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Thanks are due to the many people who have contributed to banding fieldwork including the deployment and retrieval of geolocators in north-west Australia: members of the AWSG, the annual NWA Wader and Tern Expedi- tions, the Global Flyway Network participants and visitors to Broome Bird Observatory.

Furthermore, we aimed to make use of the slight changes in light intensities at the breeding sites with 24 hours daylight to estimate the breeding location of each bird and draw inferences on incubation and chick rearing behaviour using light patterns and temperature recordings of the tags.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,154668356,,,-41.008495,-71.170433,\"Ovis aries di Virgilio Patagonia\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,212430563,,,37.7185903255882,-118.828125,\"BIRD22\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,155387370,,,45.0,34.0,\"argos-xml-upload-test-2\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,155391252,,,45.0,34.0,\"argos-xml-upload-test-3\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,64455382,,,-49.32512199104,69.5654296875,\"BBAL_GPS_Tyson\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,156434776,,,33.7243396617476,-116.71875,\"puma_SOCAL_deployed\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,156515979,,,12.57,55.61,\"Willow warbler (phylloscopus trochilus)\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,156613540,,,46.0732306254084,-79.453125,\"BAEAFILT1.0\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,156647710,,,45.5832897560063,-80.15625,\"BAEAFILT1.1\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,184555533,,,26.4622748140871,-82.1260643005371,\"Mangrove Cuckoo (Coccyzus minor) home range and seasonal movements in Florida, USA\",,,,,,,,\"I used radio-telemetry to follow the movements of 32 Mangrove Cuckoos captured on Sanibel Island, Florida, USA, and the adjacent mainland near Fort Myers, Florida, USA from April 2012 until May 2015.

One method of removing predators is to relocate “problem raptors” away from the Base, a process also known as translocation. The Base and others have used translocation without fully assessing the efficacy of this method since it has relied on the identification of returning individuals with previously attached, unique, leg colorbands. This study quantified return rates and survival of raptors fitted with satellite transmitters and translocated distances greater than those recommended by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Success was measured by survival of the translocated raptors for at least 60 days following release, and whether they returned to the least tern and plover nesting colonies during the breeding season. Over three breeding seasons we translocated 20 raptors of five different species fitted with transmitters; all birds were moved a minimum of 240 miles and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) were moved at least 500 miles. Most (80%) of the translocated birds survived 60 days or longer following translocation. Northern harriers (Circus cyaneus) were the most frequently documented and translocated “problem raptor,” including one nesting male that was captured and translocated in two different years. Birds returned to MCBCP 12 times; only one, an adult northern harrier, returned prior to 15 Aug. Juvenile red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicencis) generally moved along their expected migration path north to the Great Basin before returning south to the Base. Eleven birds died during the course of the study, including one that was lethally removed for repeatedly depredating least terns at Batiquitos Lagoon, south of the Base. There is some evidence to suggest that birds that had achieved breeding age returned more quickly to the Base and survived longer; the individual that returned the fastest was a bird known to have a nest with eggs at the time of translocation; however our sample size was small and there were no significant differences in return rates or mortality based on species, age, sex, or breeding status. We recommend an approach to “problem raptors” of different species and breeding status based on these initial results. We also recommend that future studies might use satellite or cellular transmitters to compare return rates of raptors translocated the shorter USFWS-recommended distances with the results from this effort. In addition, we also recommend investigating the effect of a short period of captivity after initial capture, to further reduce homing behavior, coupled with translocation\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Victorian Ornithological Research Group\",,,true,false,164746485,,,-38.5082810160757,145.149908065796,\"Short Tailed Shearwaters Summerlands Phillip Island Victoria Australia\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,185510555,,,35.7819975975815,-78.6381888430333,\"PetCatsTest3\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,165928772,,,37.021,-6.433,\"test 2013\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,165929552,,,37.021,-6.433,\"test 2014\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,165888137,,,37.021,-6.443,\"Equus caballus vs5 2014\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,165889434,,,37.021,-6.443,\"Equus caballus vs5 2013\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,166270981,,,38.160183,-77.103965,\"BASH\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,166509889,,,40.848167,-74.211861,\"GOEA_east\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,166529112,,,40.02233,-78.73567,\"PTT_data\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,166410847,,,43.75,3.223,\"Golden Eagle_Itty_France(Herault)\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,166627985,,,34.0,33.0,\"Stork_fldg2mig_env\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Briedis M.; Hahn S.; Gustafsson L.; Henshaw I.; Träff J.; Král M.; Adamík P.: Breeding latitude leads to different temporal but not spatial organization of the annual cycle in a long-distance migrant.

We used a Bayesian state-space model to estimate the most likely breeding locations. All four birds spent the breeding season on the coast of the Gulf of Alaska. These locations spanned approximately 1200 kilometers, and none of the individuals bred in the same location. Speed of migration was nearly twice as fast during spring than fall. The return rate of birds tagged the previous season (33%) was similar to that of control birds (39%), but comparing return rates was complicated because 7 of 11 returning birds had lost their tags.

Spectacled eiders spend 8-10 months at-sea at what were then unknown locations.  We deployed 88 satellite transmitters in Russia (Indigirka River Delta) and Alaska (Prudhoe Bay and Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta) during 1993-1996 to locate eiders when at-sea, follow their movements and identify key areas at-sea. These data have been used in studies of the annual distribution, migration, winter ecology, shifts in at-sea molting distribution, winter habitat and use of stop-over sites. Importantly, the data archived here were used in developing the Spectacled Eider Recovery Plan, were instrumental in defining when and where birds occurred for protection from disturbance and delineating critical habitat, and invaluable to developing recommendations of studies and management actions submitted to the USFWS by the Spectacled Eider Recovery Team.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"James Sheppard SDZG\",,\"James Sheppard SDZG\",,,true,false,220593004,,,31.0529339857051,-115.48828125,\"Condor GPS data for NGC helix plots\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,221337545,,,45.0,34.0,\"messaging-test-3\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,221543738,,,-2.4139602845827,-44.0926837921143,\"Whimbrels NE Brazil\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Graña Grilli M, Lambertucci SA, Therrien J-F, Bildstein KL (2016) Wing size but not wing shape is related to migratory behavior in a soaring bird.

We studied IOHC around a suburban nature preserve. Mail surveys indicated an average of 0.275 IOHC/house, leading to a regional density estimate of 0.32 IOHC/ha. A geographic model of cat density was created based on local house density and distance from forest/neighborhood edge. IOHC hunted mostly small mammals, averaging 1.67 prey brought home/cat/month and a kill rate of 13%. Predation rates based on kills brought home was lower than the estimate from observing hunting cats (5.54 kills/cat/month). IOHC spent most outside time in their or their neighbors' yard, or in the nearby forest edge; 80% of observed hunts occurred in a yard or first 10m of forest. Radio-tracked IOHC averaged 0.24ha in home rang size (95% MCP) and rarely entered forest. Confirming this, scent stations detected cats more often near edge, and more cats were detected in smaller forest fragments. There was no relationship between the number of cats detected in an area and the local small mammal abundance or seed predation rates. Cold weather and healthy cat predator populations are speculated to minimize the ecological impact of IOHC on this area.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,\"MPIO Doctoral Project\",true,false,1541435,,,47.768007,9.070922,\"MPIO European Blackbird Bodanruck\",71,2263,71,79,,\"afudickar@orn.mpg.de\",\"Adam Michael Fudickar\",\"Annual Movement Ecology of a Partial Migrant\",\"research\",false,2010-06-01 00:00:00.000,2009-01-02 00:12:00.000,false,true\r\n,,,,\"Provincie Limburg\",true,false,4502577,,,50.9030328311126,5.86669921875,\"Eagle owls - 3 breeding pairs - Southern Part The Netherlands\",,,,,,,,\"3 breeding pairs (6 adults) caught by a springnet and transmittered to search too high concentrations of PCB's in the ground.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,4556149,,,-37.8054439493427,141.9873046875,\"Brolga (Grus rubicunda), Australia\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,2364710,,,-42.5530802889558,172.96875,\"Gannets NZ Raubenheimer\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,446663,,,39.18,119.055,\"MPIO White Stork Oriental Argos\",8,51084,8,8,,\"Berthold@orn.mpg.de  \",\"Peter Berthold\",,\"research\",false,2001-11-18 07:13:58.000,1998-06-30 03:42:19.000,false,true\r\n,,\"data collected by Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Vogelwarte Radolfzell, Radolfzell, Germany\",,,true,false,2988321,\"Data can be used for educational purposes without prior permission if it is properly cited.

The coyote (Canis latrans) expanded into the northeast taking advantage of this vacant predator niche. Since 1970, coyotes have been widespread across all of mainland New York, yet no study has examined how well coyotes survive in suburban areas in this region and little is known of their ecological roles or potential to conflict with people. This information is important because in western states coyotes have high survival rates, a high degree of urban association and cause conflict with people. I studied survivorship and correlates of cause-specific mortality of coyotes using radio telemetry. The annual survival rate was 0.20 ± 0.14. There were no differences in survival rates between sexes, age classes, home range location, or capture methods. Collisions with vehicles (n = 7) and shooting (n = 6) accounted for the 2 major mortality factors. Coyotes that were killed by vehicles crossed roads more often than all other coyotes, though they did not have more roads within their home ranges. Coyotes that were shot had a larger mean and maximum open habitat patch size within their home ranges. High exploitation of the local coyote population may cause coyotes to avoid human-developed lands thus reducing the potential for negative interactions with people. \nI concurrently studied home range and habitat selection of coyotes in the suburban Albany Pine Bush landscape. Fixed kernel and minimum convex polygon (95%) home ranges (n = 17) averaged 6.81 km2 and 5.75 km2, respectively. Habitat analysis revealed that coyotes selected for natural habitat and avoided residential and commercial lands when locating a home range area and moving within the home range. Compositional analysis additionally ranked natural habitat as the most selected habitat at 2 spatial scales of selection (62.3% and 74.5%).

Here we report the results of a pilot satellite tracking study aimed at establishing the scale of movement of the straw-coloured fruit bat Eidolon helvum. This was the first ever attempt to track African fruit bats using satellite telemetry. We tagged four bats with solar-charged 12 g satellite transmitters at Kasanka National Park in December 2005 and obtained a combined total of 104 different location fixes over a 149-day period. Before migrating, bats foraged as far as 59 km from the roost in a single evening; by contrast, one migrating individual moved 370 km in one night. Bats travelled an average 29 km day−1 over the period of study, with bats that appeared to be migrating moving north-west from Kasanka at an average 90 km day−1. The greatest cumulative distance travelled by a single bat was 2518 km in 149 days. The results show conclusively that the straw-coloured fruit bat E. helvum is capable of migrating thousands of kilometres across central Africa on an annual basis, implying that the fruit pulse in northern Zambia is richer than anything on offer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the same time of the year.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,1515547,,,-7.2184,141.5449,\"DCIE - Wandering Whistling-Duck \",22,12982,22,22,,,,,\"research\",false,2010-03-03 09:34:12.000,2007-07-30 19:01:00.000,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,5975398,,,-33.8641439799194,151.216163635254,\"Bat Pteropus poliocephalus Sydney, Aust \",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"(1) Sapir, N., Horvitz, N., Wikelski, M., Mahrer, Y., Avissar, R. and Nathan, R. 2011.

Worldwide, there is only one (!) Individuals left in the Middle East showing the species-specific migratory behavior. Apart of this individual, only some wild and semi-wild sedentary free-flying colonies and several zoo colonies are remaining. \n\nFor 10 years, the Waldrappteam and its partners particular aim is to preserve the NBI as a migratory species from extinction, by creating new Migration traditions with descendants of European Zoo-Populations. A first migratory colony could be established. The birds breed in Burghausen/Bavaria and winter in the WWF Oasi Laguna di Orbetello/Tuscany. \n\nIn 2014 a project, co-financed by the European Commission (LIFE+), starts. It aims to establish three migratory NBI colonies in Europe, with breeding areas north of the Alps and a common migration tradition to a wintering area in the southern Tuscany/Italy. \n\nAll birds are equipped with GPS tags. The major aim for tagging is to implement actions against illegal hunting in Italy, the major threat for the free-flying birds. Two birds are currently tagged with solar-tags provided by the MPIO. Our aim for the near future is to publish the majority of track via Movebank. \n\nThe migration corridor ranges from Bavaria to the southern Tuscany, directly across the Alps and the Apennine. Major movements of adult birds along the migration corridor occur during the migration periods, which last from April till May (spring) resp. from August till October (autumn). Juvenile and sub-adult NBIs fly in the range of the migration corridor from April till October.  \",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"Kyle Spragens, Ack: Cemal Ozsemir, Sedat Inak, Nizamettin Yavuz, Nicolas Tubbs.\",,,,,true,false,3291979,,,41.641,36.069,\"FAO-USGS_Turkey\",,,,,\"John Takekawa PhD.\r\nUSGS Western Ecological Research Center, SFB Estuary Station\r\n505 Azuar Drive\r\nVallejo, CA 94592 USA\r\n\r\n; Scott Newman DVM, PhD.\r\nEMPRES Animal Health - Wildlife Health and Ecology Unit, Emergency Center for Transboundry Animal Diseases, Animal Production and Health Division, Food and Agriculture Orginization of the United Nations\r\nRome, Italy 00153\",\"john_takekawa@usgs.gov, scott.newman@fao.org\",\"John Takekawa, Scott Newman, Kiraz Erciyas Yavuz, Yakup Sancar Baris\",\"Examine movements of migratory birds in relation to potential transmission of HPAI H5N1.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Baoping Yan, Delong Zhao, Glenn Olsen, Boripat Siriaroonrat\r\n\",,,,,true,false,3291871,,,29.15,116.17,\"FAO-USGS_China-Poyang\",,,,,\"John Takekawa PhD.\r\nUSGS Western Ecological Research Center, SFB Estuary Station\r\n505 Azuar Drive\r\nVallejo, CA 94592 USA\r\n\r\n; Scott Newman DVM, PhD.\r\nEMPRES Animal Health - Wildlife Health and Ecology Unit, Emergency Center for Transboundry Animal Diseases, Animal Production and Health Division, Food and Agriculture Orginization of the United Nations\r\nRome, Italy 00153\",\"john_takekawa@usgs.gov, scott.newman@fao.org\",\"John Takekawa, Scott Newman, Xiangming Xiao, Fumin Lei, Weitao Ji\",\"Examine movements of migratory birds in relation to potential transmission of HPAI H5N1.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Jeffrey A.

Such an adaptation should allow animals to reduce the cost of having a larger home range in areas with relatively low food availability. We studied how space and refuge use varied with local food availability in the Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata), a refuge-inhabiting rodent. We tested whether agoutis living in areas of relatively low food availability had larger home ranges, and whether this response was accompanied by an increase in the number of refuges used. We monitored agoutis in areas with contrasting densities of their principal food source the black palm (Astrocaryum standleyanum). We used both automated and manual radio telemetry to measure space use during the day and refuge use at night. Agoutis living in areas of low food availability had larger home ranges. All individuals used multiple refuges and the number of refuges was not correlated with home range size. Consequently, agoutis that had larger home ranges were forced to roam farther from their nearest refuge to find food. Our results do not support the hypothesis that prey animals use more refuges as they forage across a larger area. Agoutis with large home ranges and low-quality habitat should therefore face an elevated predation risk because they have to spend more time traveling, more time foraging, and are farther away from refuges on average. We hypothesize that agoutis, regardless of their home range size, use multiple refuges to reduce predictability to predators or reduce parasite loads.\n\nNote that some locations were collected with manual radio-telemetry and others with automated radio telemetry.

Our understanding, however, of the strategies used in pursuit and evasion remains limited. Here we report on the hunting dynamics of the world’s fastest land animal, the cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus. Using miniaturized data loggers, we recorded fine-scale movement, speed and acceleration of free-ranging cheetahs to measure how hunting dynamics relate to chasing different sized prey. Cheetahs attained hunting speeds of up to 18.94 m/s and accelerated up to 7.5 m/s2 with greatest angular velocities achieved during the terminal phase of the hunt. The interplay between forward and lateral acceleration during chases showed that the total forces involved in speed changes and turning were approximately constant over time but varied with prey type. Thus, rather than a simple maximum speed chase, cheetahs first accelerate to decrease the distance to their prey, before reducing speed 5-8 s from the end of the hunt, so as to facilitate rapid turns to match prey escape tactics, varying the precise strategy according to prey species. Predator and prey thus pit a fine balance of speed against manoeuvring capability in a race for survival.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,10982257,,,57.761,-133.599,\"2008 harbor seals TAFT\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,2249221,\"Only the collaborators named in Movebank for this study may access this data.

Trapping occurred between April  1 – April 10, 2013. All 52 vultures received pink patagial wing tags in the patagium of the right wing.  From the group of 52 trapped vultures, six received 70g solar Argos PTT-100 GPS transmitters (four Black Vultures and two Turkey Vultures). All tagged vultures, including the six with transmitters, were released from the tagging site during  the afternoon and evening of April 10, 2013. The deployment-on time is 2:00 AM (CST) on April 11, 2013 to allow for consistency in the data analysis. \nPrior to transmitter deployment, the transmitters were pre-programmed to record 19 Geographical Positioning System (GPS) location fixes per day. The fix times selected were based on the hours of sunrise and sunset in deployment-on location (Freeman Ranch in San Marcos, TX). Sunrise and sunset times for the entire year were considered and the chosen fix times allowed for hourly GPS fixes during the day and then periodic GPS fixes during the night. The need to include gaps in the nighttime fix rate was to conserve transmitter battery power, which operates using solar energy. \n\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,18799256,,,21.2893743558604,-91.40625,\"Sea turtles from the suthern Gulf of Mexico\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,\"NSF LTREB DEB0717243\",true,false,11828763,\"No use for any purpose without written permission from Nathan W.

Utilization distributions have become one of the most common ways to quantify space use and have advanced our knowledge of animal ecology in a variety of ways. However, until recently, they were limited to two dimensions (2D), despite the fact that a majority of taxa use their environments in all three spatial dimensions (3D). In this study we: 1) demonstrate the creation of 3D utilization distributions via a multivariate kernel density estimator, 2) adapt two joint space use indices for use with 3D data, and 3) assess these methods using data from American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) during their non-breeding season in Jamaica. We found that, compared to 3D methods, 2D methods overestimated individual (pairwise) spatial overlap by 3% in scrub habitat and 4% in mangrove habitat. Similarly, 2D methods overestimated total (all neighbors combined) spatial overlap by 9% in scrub and 12% in mangrove habitat. Using joint space use indices, we also found that American Redstarts avoided areas of overlap to some degree, possibly to limit agonistic interactions with neighbors. Although 3D methods require larger sample sizes (80-110 locations) than 2D (40-70 locations), we argue that modeling animal space use in 3D is more realistic and will enhance understanding of niche differentiation, inter- and intra-specific competition, habitat selection and use, and wildlife conservation.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,124707,\"Contact PI for permission for any purpose\",,12.13,-15.223,\"Osprey Reintroduction -Spain\",10,1382,10,10,,,,\"Satellite telemetry of migration of reintroduced Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) in Andalusia (Spain).\n\nReference (reintroduction project):\nMuriel et al. 2010.

Walruses winter together in the Bering Sea but females with calves and subadults summer in the Chukchi Sea using sea ice as a resting platform while feeding on the shallow sea floor; whereas most adult males remain in the Bering Sea where they use terrestrial haulouts for resting. The rapid retreat of sea ice in recent years is changing walrus summer habitat in the Chukchi Sea and may be changing summer distribution and haulout behavior, requiring that walruses haul out on land instead of ice. Oil and gas activity has recently increased in the Chukchi Sea, increasing the importance of improving our understanding of walrus movements, feeding behavior, and habitat requirements to develop effective mitigation measures for the conservation and management of the species. Satellite-linked transmitters placed on walruses near the communities of Little Diomede, Shishmaref, Point Hope, Point Lay, Wainwright, and Barrow in spring, summer, and fall would provide information on movements, speed of travel, feeding areas, and haulout behavior. Working cooperatively with the Eskimo Walrus Commission and walrus hunters from these communities, we have designed a study to deploy satellite transmitters and conduct counts and observations of walruses on haulouts near villages in spring and fall. Traditional ecological knowledge will also be collected and integrated into the results. These data will provide information that will help answer important questions about walrus movements, feeding areas, haulout behavior, migration timing, and body condition that will improve our understanding of habitats important to walruses. The study will be conducted over a 5-year period, is designed so that is does not interfere with subsistence walrus hunting activities and is funded by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). \",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Field work at Donana Biological Station, Sevilla; Junta de Andalucia, Spain; Max-Planck Institute for Ornithology; Tufts University\",,\"Blas, Wikelski, Tella, Carrete, Romero, et al., in prep.\",,\"Max-Planck Institute for Ornithology; Spanish Ministry of Science\",true,false,2988357,\"Please do not use any data without contacting the PI or authors.\",,37.066,-6.125,\"MPIO_White_Stork_Donana\",,,,,,,,\"to determine life history implications of early stress during ontogeny.

This infrastructure includes state-of-the-art acoustic receivers and oceanographic monitoring equipment, and autonomous marine vehicles carrying oceanographic sensors and mobile acoustic receivers. Long-life acoustic tags (n=40) implanted in the experimental animals will provide long-term spatial resolution of shark movements and distribution, trans-boundary migrations, site fidelity, and the species’ response to a changing ocean. This study will facilitate interspecific comparisons, documentation of intra- and interspecific interactions, and permit long-term monitoring of this understudied predator in the Northwest Atlantic. The study will also provide basic and necessary information to better inform fisheries managers and policy makers.

Thus again they become a key role in the functioning of ecosystems being also an important socioeconomic resource. Andalusia hosts important populations of native and introduced wild ungulates and game management is a dynamic element of rural economies and a source of food resources for communities of vertebrate scavengers many of which are endangered species. In fact, the binomial ungulates-scavengers provide an important ecosystem service that has hardly been studied. This project aims to address the interactions between conservation biology and game management. With this overall objective is intended to analyze the factors that determine the structure and functioning of food webs associated scavengers to the big game, the movement patterns of resource consumers that have different spatial and temporal predictability, the capacity of the system to maintain viable populations of carrion birds and, finally, to evaluate some of the emerging risks associated with consumption of carcasses of large game such as lead poisoning.\n\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,70895586,\"No use for any purpose without PI's permission\",,9.1504009192186,-79.7358512878418,\"SNP Ocelot tracking\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,21368764,,,24.559,93.915,\"FAO-USGS  India-2011\",,,,,,,,\"Examine movements of migratory birds in relation to potential transmission of HPAI H5N1.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Vet School Banda Aceh and BKSDA, MPIO\",,\"Wikelski et al.

The species, which occurs only in the new World, can be seen as far north as southern Canada and as far south as Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America.  Turkey Vultures also occur on many large and small islands including Vancouver Island, Canada, Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea, and the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic.  Six races or subspecies of Turkey Vultures are recognized by biologists:  including septentrionalis in eastern North America, meridionalis in western North America, aura in Mexico, parts of the Caribbean and Central America, ruficollis in southern Central and northern and central South America, jota in South America and falklandica in southern South America and the Falkland Islands.  The scientific name for Turkey Vulture, Cathartes aura, translates as “breezy cleanser,” most likely a reflection of its soaring and scavenging life style. \r\n\r\nScientists consider North American populations of Turkey Vultures to be partial migrants, in that northern populations of the species migrate, whereas southern populations, in general, do not.  Eastern North American populations of the species typically migrate no farther south than Florida and Texas.  Western populations travel at least as far as Colombia and Venezuela, and some experts believe that some western birds may travel as far south as Brazil and Argentina.  Millions of migrating Turkey Vultures have been counted annually at migration watch sites in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama.\r\n\r\nAs scientists we are interested in learning more about the movement ecology of this extremely successful raptor, which seems to have one of the most flexible of all avian migration systems.  Earlier reports from northern South America suggest that northern migrants, which are larger and more massive than local residents, dominate the latter when they arrive on their wintering grounds in December each year.  The extent to which such dominance affects the breeding schedules and numbers of southern birds remains unknown, as does the extent to which individual migrants visit an over-winter in the same location each year.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2003 Hawk Mountain Sanctuary initiated a long-term study of migration behavior in Turkey Vultures in an effort to learn more about the extent, causes, and consequences of their annual journeys.  To date scientists at the sanctuary and its collaborators have placed tiny radio tags monitored by satellite on 21 Turkey Vultures in an effort to follow their outbound migrations south each autumn and their return migrations north each spring.  Five of the satellite-tracked birds also had a data logger surgically implanted in their body cavities.  The loggers record both core body temperature and heart rate.  Recovering these data loggers allows us to determine fluctuations in both body temperature and heart rate associated with day-night cycles and migration activity.  The Sanctuary and its collaborators also have placed red, yellow, or light blue numbered wing tags on more than one hundred Turkey Vultures in Canada, Venezuela, and the United States.\r\n\",\"research\",true,2010-04-27 23:00:00.000,2003-11-05 15:00:00.000,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,52519599,,,51.728226,-2.37766299999998,\"Red Breasted Geese.

The success of either migratory strategy is the result of differential forage selection and predation risk-avoidance. In this dissertation, I examine how multi-scale resource selection by migrant and resident elk (Cervus elaphus) differentially influence demography. I studied the partially migratory Ya Ha Tinda elk population, which winters in the province of Alberta and migrates in summer to Banff National Park. I reviewed population trends from 1970–2005, and found the migrant proportion declined from 95% to 60%. To examine the role of differential forage selection, I built a spatially and temporally-explicit forage model using field and remote sensing data to predict available forage biomass and quality to elk. By selecting intermediate forage biomass in phenologically delayed areas, migrants had 5% higher forage digestibility than residents. Next, I developed a spatially and temporally explicit predation risk model for wolves (Canis lupus), elk’s main predator. Predation risk at the summer range scale was 70% lower for migrants compared to residents. Yet, despite riskier summer ranges, resident elk adopted fine-scale foraging and anti-predator strategies within these ranges to reduce the risk they experienced to only 15% higher than that of migrants. Furthermore, predation risk experienced by migrants during migratory periods was 52% higher than residents. Differences in resource selection translated to demographic differences between strategies in Leslie-matrix models. Bottom-up effects manifested in higher pregnancy rates and female calf weights for migrants. Yet top-down effects of predation by wolves and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) were greater for migrants, who experienced lower adult and calf survival. Resident adult and calf survival was higher despite poorer forage because of fine-scale risk-avoidance combined with a behavioural response to live in larger group sizes in summer. The ratio of migrant to resident population growth rates from Leslie-matrix models matched the observed rate of migratory decline from 1970-2005. I conclude that given current conditions, notwithstanding potential density-dependent processes, the proportion of migrants in this population will continue to decline as a result of top-down limitation despite the significant benefits of higher forage quality from migration.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,57787054,,,28.3043806829628,-98.4375,\"Welder\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Environmental Management Directorate, Marine Section of the Government of St Helena (Annalea Beard, Leann Henry, Elizabeth Clingham).\",,\"St Helena seabird tracking data\",,\"RSPB core funding, Enterprise St Helena\",true,false,16050923,\"Contact PI for data sharing and collaboration\",,-15.9262130220657,-5.72057247161865,\"St Helena seabird tracking\",,,,,,,,\"Tracking of Red-billed Tropicbirds and Masked Boobies from St Helena to identify foraging areas and guide the development of marine protected areas.\",\"research\",true,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,113636867,,,59.4255217577488,-146.343383789062,\"Kittiwakes2015\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,66206023,,,47.768060755047,8.99677276611328,\"Black grouse Austria\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,184173889,,,54.3898415327739,12.9500859975815,\"GPS 16075\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,139643269,,,9.34657944338208,-62.8298020362854,\"BILO Guianas tracks\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,8317873,,,69.0842570505314,-52.0751953125,\"Common/King Eiders; Nuuk/Disko Bay/Upernavik, Greenland; Gilchrist/Mosbech; 2002 and 2003\",,,,,\"National Wildlife Research Center,\nCarleton University\n1125 Colonel By Drive\nOttawa, ON K1A 0H3\",\"Grant.Gilchrist@ec.gc.ca\",\"Grant Gilchrist\",,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,59355933,,,47.7753291463037,9.03282165527344,\"VTK2015 blackbirds bodanruck\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Funding from NHK for GPS collars\",,\"Powell RA, Ellwood S, Kays R (in prep) Stink or swim: techniques to meet the challenges for the study and conservation of small critters that hide, swim or climb and may otherwise make themselves unpleasant.

The North American race (N.p. hudsonicus) includes two disjunct breeding populations, both of which winter primarily in Central and South America. The western population breeds in Alaska and the Northwest Territories of Canada. The eastern population breeds south and west of Hudson Bay in Manitoba and Ontario. The prevailing idea was that the western population followed a Pacific Coast migration route between breeding and wintering areas in Panama and western South America, and that the Hudson Bay population followed an Atlantic Coast migration route to wintering grounds in Northeast South America. Both populations are of high conservation concern due to population declines in recent decades . Investigations into the migration routes of whimbrels staging in Virginia have shown a previously unknown link between the eastern and western populations as they stop-over in Virginia. The primary objective of this project is to examine the stop-over and migration strategies of whimbrels, as they relate to the conservation of the species. A total of 23 9.5 and 5 gram PTT satellite transmitters were deployed during the 2009-2012 spring and fall migration seasons and summer breeding seasons. Several unusual migration events were observed during the spring and fall seasons. \",\"research\",false,,,true,true\r\n,,,,\"MPIO, UiT\",true,false,56483688,,,69.1508306592036,49.163818359375,\"Arctic Fox\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,9785408,,,36.95208671787,-76.4373779296875,\"Pandion haliaetus Osprey Chesapeake Bay Mojica/Watts\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Mojica, E.K. and B.D.

Using six years of presence-absence data (2007–2012) spanning years of record-breaking drought and flood conditions, we evaluated regional occupancy dynamics of American mink (Neovison vison) and muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) in a highly altered agroecosystem in Illinois, USA. We used noninvasive sign surveys and a multiseason occupancy modeling approach to estimate annual occupancy rates for both species and related these rates to summer precipitation. We also tracked radiomarked individuals to assess mortality risk for both species when moving in terrestrial areas. Annual model-averaged estimates of occupancy for mink and muskrat were correlated positively to summer precipitation. Mink and muskrats were widespread during a year (2008) with above-average precipitation. However, estimates of site occupancy declined substantially for mink (0.56) and especially muskrats (0.09) during the severe drought of 2012. Mink are generalist predators that probably use terrestrial habitat during droughts. However, mink had substantially greater risk of mortality away from streams. In comparison, muskrats are more restricted to aquatic habitats and likely suffered high mortality during the drought. Our patterns are striking, but a more mechanistic understanding is needed of how semiaquatic species in human-modified ecosystems will respond ecologically in situ to extreme weather events predicted by climate-change models.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,\"Paviolo, A\",,,true,false,107337222,,,-25.649125,-54.396942,\"Jaguar Conservation in Argentina\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"We thank T.

The population has been monitored since 1998 so that 90% of the birds are now individualized by means of plastic rings. The Canarian Egyptian vulture population is increasing about 5% per year but still supports relatively high rates of unnatural deaths, mainly caused by accidents on power lines, although the impact of toxic compounds as lead from ammunition and veterinary drugs plays also a relevant role.

Using light-level geolocation, we obtained three full annual tracks and one autumn migration track of male red-necked phalaropes caught during breeding in Scandinavia. These tracks confirmed expectations that individuals from the Scandinavian population winter in the Arabian Sea. Migration was accomplished in two to four migration leaps, staging for a few days in the Gulf of Finland (autumn) or the southern Baltic Sea (spring) and for up to a month in or near the Black and Caspian Sea (autumn and spring). In addition, travel speeds suggested that only the flights between the Baltic and Black/Caspian Sea are non-stop, and thus the birds seem to make additional short stops during the other flights. Stopover time in the Black/Caspian Sea is only 8-10 days in spring but up to 36 days in autumn, which is longer than expected if only used for pre-migratory fattening to cover the ca. 2000 km to the Gulf of Oman. After entering the Arabian Sea via the Gulf of Oman, birds dispersed over the entire presumed winter range. Winter movements appear to correspond to the spatio-temporal patterns in primary production linked to seasonally changing monsoon winds. These are not only the first tracks of Scandinavian red-necked phalaropes, but also the first seabird tracks in the Arabian Sea, one of the most productive and dynamic marine areas on the planet.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"WWF-Nedbank Greentrust\nPelicase South Africa\",,,,,true,false,110218293,,,-33.0224819196136,21.258544921875,\"Karoo Predator Project\",,,,,,,,\"The Karoo Predator Project conducts research on biodiversity, farming and predator ecology on farmlands in the South African Karoo to mitigate conflict between mesocarnivores and small-livestock farmers\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"all credits due to Michael Abedi-Lartey, Dina Dechmann and Jakob Fahr\",,,,\"Max Planck Society\",true,false,14253246,\"use of data only permitted after obtaining licence from PIs (MPIO)\",,12.3974207286262,-1.48873329162598,\"Eidolon helvum; Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou; wet season 2013 [eobs]\",,,,,,,,\"African straw-coloured fruit bat\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Wellington City Council\",,,,\"WWF-New Zealand Conservation Innovation Award\",true,false,47449884,\"All material published as part of this project is protected by copyright.

However, the nature of the cues used by migratory birds to perform long distance navigation is still debated. In this experiment we subjected adult lesser black-backed gulls migrating from their Finnish/Russian breeding grounds (from >60°N) to Africa (to < 5°N) to sensory manipulation, to determine the sensory systems required for navigation. We translocated birds westward (1080 km) or eastward (885 km) to simulate natural navigational challenges. When translocated westwards and outside their migratory corridor birds with olfactory nerve section kept a clear directional preference (southerly) but were unable to compensate for the displacement, while intact birds and gulls with the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve sectioned oriented towards their population-specific migratory corridor. Thus, air-borne olfactory information seems to be important for migrating gulls to navigate successfully in some circumstances.

State-space modelling can circumvent some of the inherent limitations of Argos datasets, such as the limited temporal resolution of locations and the lack of information pertaining to the behavioural state of the tracked individuals at each location. We coupled state-space modelling with environmental characterisation of modelled locations on a 3-year Argos dataset of 9 breeding snowy owls to assess whether searching behaviour for breeding sites was affected by snow cover and depth in an arctic predator that shows a lack of breeding site fidelity. The state-space modelling approach allowed the discrimination of two behavioural states (searching and moving) during pre-breeding movements. Tracked snowy owls constantly switched from moving to searching behaviour during pre-breeding movements from mid-March to early June. Searching events were more likely where snow cover and depth was low. This suggests that snowy owls adapt their searching effort to environmental conditions encountered along their path.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,\"van Bommel L, Johnson CN (2014) Where do livestock guardian dogs go?

The Lévy-flight foraging hypothesis (LFFH) suggests a single optimal food search strategy to explain this pattern, yet mixed movement distributions are biologically more plausible and often convincingly fit movement data. To confront alternative explanations for these patterns, we tracked vultures of three species in two very different ecosystems using high-resolution GPS/accelerometer tags accompanied by behavioral, genetic and morphological data. The Lévy distribution fitted the datasets reasonably well, matching expectations based on their sparsely distributed food resources; yet, the fit of mixed models was considerably better, suggesting distinct movement modes operating at three different scales. Specifically, long-range forays (LRFs)—rare, short-term, large-scale circular journeys that greatly exceed the typical foraging range and contribute to the tail-fatness of the movement distribution in all three species—do not match an optimal foraging strategy suggested by the LFFH. We also found no support for preferred weather conditions or population genetic structure as alternative explanations, so the hypothesis that LRFs represent failed breeding dispersal attempts to find mates remains our most plausible explanation at this time. We conclude that inference about the mechanisms underlying animal movements should be confronted with complementary data, and suggest that mixed behavioral-modes likely explain commonly observed fat-tailed movement distributions.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"We thank the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism for permission to do this research (permits: 1221/2007, 1331/2009).

Interspecific differences in morphology (through the effect on perceptual range and motion ability) and searchers’ spatial dispersion (due to different roost arrangements) are in correspondence with the empirically observed advantage of LFV over WBV searchers, whereas differences in other aspects of the movement patterns appear to play a minor role.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"Metroparks of the Toledo Area and\nThe Nature Conservancy of Ohio\",,\"Ross JD, Bridge ES, Rozmarynowycz MJ, Bingman VP (2013) Geolocator-tracked variation in migratory behavior within a highly site-faithful population of Lark Sparrows (Chondestes grammacus).

We compared two contexts of flock composition: flocks of birds of the same age and flight experience; and, flocks of birds of different ages and flight experience. All flocks displayed consistent leadership-based structures over time, showing that individuals have stable roles in the navigational decisions of the flock. However, flocks of balanced age and flight experience exhibited reduced leadership stability, indicating that these factors promote flock structuring. Our study empirically demonstrates that leadership and followership are consistent behaviours in homing pigeon flocks, but such consistency is affected by the heterogeneity of individual flight experiences and/or age. Similar evidence from other species suggests leadership as an important mechanism for coordinated motion in small groups of animals with strong social bonds.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"Data belong to Dutch Montagu's Harrier Foundation\",,\"Trierweiler C, Klaassen RHG, Drent RH, Exo K-M, Komdeur J, Bairlein F, Koks BJ (2014) Migratory connectivity and population specific migration routes in a long-distance migratory bird.

The griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) is one of the species at higher risk in Spain.  Important densities of griffons are found in the mountain ranges of northern and western Pyrenees and the high Ebro valley.  An aircraft military firing range occupies 2,200 ha in the centre of the Bardena Reales Natural Park. The air exercises involve aircraft flying at different heights on colonies of griffon vulture and broad areas of extensive and intensive livestock farming where vultures and other scavengers feed daily.  As a consequence of this bird strikes have occurred. In view of the problem it is advisable to initiate studies aimed at understanding the dynamics of use of space for griffon vultures in this region. The solutions pass to generate knowledge in order to facilitate decision-making on issues such as the manipulation of habitat quality (food resources in critical areas) and optimizing flight routes and strategies of the aircraft in relation to patterns of displacement of birds. The specific objectives would be therefore to: a) Establish spatio-temporal routines of adult breeding griffon vultures in the region; b) Determine to what extent the management of livestock carcasses conditions such movements; c) Identify the factors favouring the overlap of flying activity of vultures and military aircraft exercises; d) Establish proposals to minimize the risk of collisions between vultures and military aircraft and to optimize the management of livestock carcasses for vulture conservation.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Kays, R.

The possibility of trans-Andes migration for Amazonian breeding birds has largely been discounted given the high geographic barrier posed by the Andean Cordillera and the desert habitat along much of the Pacific Coast. Here we demonstrate a trans-Andes route for Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger cinerascens) breeding on the Manu River (in the lowlands of Manu National Park, Perú), as well as divergent movement patterns both regionally and across the continent. Of eight skimmers tracked with satellite telemetry, three provided data on their outbound migrations, with two crossing the high Peruvian Andes to the Pacific. A third traveled over 1800 km to the southeast before transmissions ended in eastern Paraguay. One of the two trans-Andean migrants demonstrated a full round-trip migration back to its tagging location after traveling down the Pacific Coast from latitude 9° South to latitude 37° S, spending the austral summer in the Gulf of Arauco, Chile. This is the first documentation of a trans-Andes migration observed for any bird breeding in lowland Amazonia. To our knowledge, this research also documents the first example of a tropical-breeding waterbird migrating out of the tropics to spend the non-breeding season in the temperate summer, this being the reverse pattern with respect to seasonality for austral migrants in general.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"This project is being conducted cooperatively with many collaborators and colleagues, but in addition to the principal investigator (Russ Andrews) the main participants are Anthony Martinez (NOAA Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center), Clay George (Georgia Department of Natural Resources), Tom Pitchford and Katie Jackson (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission), Barbara Zoodsma (NMFS Southeast Regional Office), and Kylie Owen (Alaska SeaLife Center). \",,,,\"Funding was provided to the Alaska SeaLife Center by Georgia DNR, made possible due to funding from NOAA Fisheries Southeast Regional Office and T.E.R.N. \",true,false,132725152,\"Data should not be used without permission.

When predators are removed, re-colonization for some species occurs naturally, and inter-island phylogeographic relationships and current movement patterns can illuminate processes of colonization. We studied a case of re-colonization of common eiders (Somateria mollissima) following removal of introduced arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) in the Aleutian Archipelago, Alaska. We expected common eiders to resume nesting on islands cleared of foxes and to re-colonize from nearby islets, islands, and island groups. We thus expected common eiders to show limited genetic structure indicative of extensive mixing among island populations. Satellite telemetry was used to record current movement patterns of female common eiders from six islands across three island groups. We collected genetic data from these and other nesting common eiders at 14 microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial DNA control region to examine population genetic structure, historical fluctuations in population demography, and gene flow. Our results suggest recent interchange among islands. Analysis of microsatellite data supports satellite telemetry data of increased dispersal of common eiders to nearby areas and little between island groups. Although evidence from mtDNA is suggestive of female dispersal among island groups, gene flow is insufficient to account for recolonization and rapid population growth. Instead, near-by remnant populations of common eiders contributed substantially to population expansion, without which re-colonization would have likely occurred at a much lower rate. Genetic and morphometric data of common eiders within one island group two and three decades after re-colonization suggests reduced movement of eiders among islands and little movement between island groups after populations were re-established. We predict that re-colonization of an island group where all common eiders are extirpated could take decades.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"Carles Mompo, Pit Roig ringing group, J.S.

Even for the best-studied dispersal system of the Neotropics, Virola nobilis, the dispersal kernel remains unknown. We combined high-resolution GPS/3D-acceleration bird tracking, seed retention experiments, and field observations to quantify dispersal of V. nobilis by their principal dispersers, Ramphastos toucans. We inferred feeding events from movement data, and then estimated spatio-temporally explicit seed-dispersal kernels. Toucans moved an average of 1.8 km d-1 with two distinct activity peaks. Seed retention time averaged 25.5 min (range 4-98 min). Estimated seed dispersal distance averaged 144±147m, with a 56% likelihood of dispersal >100m; this is 2X further than the behaviour-naive estimate from the same data. Dispersal was furthest for seeds ingested in the morning (morning mean 152±154m, midday mean 95±83m), and increased with seed retention time, but only up to 60 min after feeding. Our study supports the long-standing hypothesis that toucans are excellent dispersers of Virola seeds. To maximize seed dispersal distances trees should ripen fruit in the morning when birds move the most, and produce fruits with gut-processing times around 60 min. We also demonstrate how new tracking technology can yield nuanced seed dispersal kernels for animals that cannot be directly observed.\",\"research\",true,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,140395916,\"Data provided by permission only.\",,17.4292696679525,96.1688232421875,\"Elephas Maximus Asian Elephant Myanmar\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Peters Wibke (2010) Resource selection and abundance estimation of moose: Implications for caribou recovery in a human altered landscape.

These intraguild interactions are key drivers of carnivore community structure with ecosystem-wide cascading effects. We examined the concurrent fine-scale movement decisions of almost all individuals of four large mammalian carnivore species in a closed terrestrial system. We found that the intensity of intraguild interactions did not follow a simple hierarchical allometric pattern, as spatial and behavioral tactics of subordinate species changed with threat and resource levels across seasons. Lions were generally unrestricted and anchored themselves in areas rich in not only their principal prey, but during periods of resource limitation (dry season), also rich in the main prey for other carnivores. Because of this, the greatest cost (potential intraguild predation) for subordinate carnivores was spatially coupled with the highest potential benefit of resource acquisition (prey-rich areas) especially in the dry season. Leopard and cheetah overlapped with the home range of lions but minimized risk using fine-scaled avoidance behaviours and restricted resource acquisition tactics. The cost of intraguild competition was most apparent for cheetahs, especially during the wet season, as areas with energetically rewarding large prey (wildebeest) were avoided when they overlapped highly with the activity areas of lions. The smallest species (African wild dog) avoided lions and used multiple tactics to minimise encountering all other competitors. Intraguild competition thus forced wild dogs into areas with the lowest resource availability year round. Coexistence of multiple carnivore species has typically been explained by dietary niche separation, but our multi-scaled movement results suggest that differences in resource acquisition may instead be a consequence of avoiding intraguild competition. We generate a more realistic representation of hierarchical behavioral interactions that may ultimately drive spatially-explicit trophic structures of multi-predator communities.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"We are very grateful to our dedicated field assistants (S.

We assessed the importance of different landscape elements (open sea, tidal flats and inland) by comparing marine and terrestrial foraging behaviours in lesser black-backed gulls breeding along the coast of the southern North Sea. We attached GPS data loggers to eight incubating birds and collected information on diet and habitat use. The loggers recorded data for 10–19 days to allow flight-path reconstruction. Lesser black-backed gulls foraged in both offshore and inland areas, but rarely on tidal flats. Targets and directions were similar among all eight individuals. Foraging trips (n = 108) lasted 0.5–26.4 h (mean 8.7 h), and ranges varied from 3.0–79.9 km (mean 30.9 km). The total distance travelled per foraging trip ranged from 7.5–333.6 km (mean 97.9 km). Trips out to sea were significantly more variable in all parameters than inland trips. Presence in inland areas was closely associated with daylight, whereas trips to sea occurred at day and night, but mostly at night. The most common items in pellets were grass (48%), insects (38%), fish (28%), litter (26%) and earthworms (20%). There was a significant relationship between the carbon and nitrogen isotope signals in blood and the proportional time each individual spent foraging at sea/land. On land, gulls preferentially foraged on bare ground, with significantly higher use of potato fields and significantly less use of grassland. The flight patterns of lesser black-backed gulls at sea overlapped with fishing-vessel distribution, including small beam trawlers fishing for shrimps in coastal waters close to the colony and large beam-trawlers fishing for flatfish at greater distances. Our data show that individuals made intensive use of the anthropogenic landscape and seascape, indicating that lesser black-backed gulls are not a predominantly marine species during the incubation period.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,118192126,,,54.6078875892922,-5.88711157586658,\"Greylag Goose Anser anser - Belfast\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Senner NR, Verhoeven MA, Abad-Gómez JM, Gutierrez JS, Hooijmeijer JC, Kentie R, Masero JA, Tibbitts TL, Piersma T (2015) When Siberia came to The Netherlands: the response of continental black-tailed godwits to a rare spring weather event.

Extreme weather events have the potential to alter both short- and long-term population dynamics as well as community- and ecosystem-level function. Such events are rare and stochastic, making it difficult to fully document how organisms respond to them and predict the repercussions of similar events in the future.<br>\n2. To improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which short-term events can incur long-term consequences, we documented the behavioural responses and fitness consequences for a long-distance migratory bird, the continental black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa limosa, resulting from a spring snowstorm and three-week period of record low temperatures.<br>\n3. The event caused measurable responses at three spatial scales—continental, regional, and local—including migratory delays (+19 d), reverse migrations (>90 km), elevated metabolic costs (+8.8% maintenance metabolic rate), and increased foraging rates (+37%).<br>\n4. There were few long-term fitness consequences, however, and subsequent breeding seasons instead witnessed high levels of reproductive success and little evidence of carry-over effects.<br>\n5. This suggests that populations with continued access to food, behavioural flexibility, and time to dissipate the costs of the event can likely withstand the consequences of an extreme weather event. For populations constrained in one of these respects, though, extreme events may entail extreme ecological consequences.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,\"Space-use Patterns of the Asiatic Wild Ass (Equus hemionus): Complementary Insights from Displacement, Recursion Movement and Habitat Selection Analyses.

However, due to limitations in the transmission abilities of the Argos system and the battery life of the tags, very little is known about fine-scale diving behaviour over time or the reliability of assigning behavioral states from horizontal movement data for whale species. Whether whales swim close to the ocean surface or complete drift dives into deeper parts of the water column while migrating has not been examined, yet the strategy used is likely to influence the vulnerability of whales to risk factors such as ship strike. Here we present information from a rare week long deployment onto a pygmy blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) that provided the first opportunity to examine the long-term diving behaviour of a migrating whale, and to compare the location of feeding lunges to assigned behavioural states. \",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,\"McIntyre CL, Douglas DC, Collopy MW (2008) Movements of golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) from interior Alaska during their first year of independence.

Following detailed atmospheric simulations, we found that bats compensated for wind drift, as predicted under constant winds, and decreased their airspeed in response to tailwind assistance such that their groundspeed remained nearly constant. In addition, bats increased their airspeed with increasing crosswind speed. Overall, bats modulated their airspeed in relation to wind speed at different wind directions in a manner predicted by a two-dimensional optimal move- ment model. We conclude that sophisticated behavioural mechanisms to minimize the cost of transport under various wind conditions have evolved in bats. The bats’ response to the wind is similar to that reported for migratory birds and insects, suggesting convergent evolution of flight behaviours in volant organisms.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"We are grateful to Fabio Chini and Daniele Santerini who greatly helped in preparing and performing the experiment.

However, the role of odours in navigation is still subject to debate. While according to the olfactory navigation hypothesis homing pigeons possess a navigational map based on the distribution of environmental odours, the olfactory activation hypothesis proposes that odour perception is only needed to activate a navigational mechanism based on cues of another nature. Here we tested experimentally whether the perception of artificial odours is sufficient to allow pigeons to navigate, as expected from the olfactory activation hypothesis. We transported three groups of pigeons in air-tight containers to release sites 53 and 61 km from home in three different olfactory conditions. The Control (C) group received natural environmental air; both the Pure Air (PA) and the Artificial Odour (AO) groups received pure air filtered through an active charcoal filter. Only the Artificial Odour group received additional puffs of artificial odours until release. We then released pigeons while recording their tracks with 1Hz GPS data loggers. We also followed non-homing pigeons using an aerial data readout to a Cessna plane, allowing, for the first time, the tracking of non-homing homing pigeons. Within the first hour after release, the pigeons in both the Artificial Odour and the Pure Air group (receiving no environmental odours) showed impaired navigational performances at each release site. Our data provide evidence against an activation role of odours in navigation, and document that pigeons only navigate well when they perceive environmental odours.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,216552786,,,54.4904628929532,10.8984375,\"FTZ sea ducks\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Thanks to the Botswana Ministry of Wildife, Environment and Tourism.\",,\"Bartlam-Brooks HLA, Beck PSA, Bohrer G, Harris S (2013) In search of greener pastures: using satellite images to predict the effects of environmental change on zebra migration.

What information individuals use for movement coordination is, however, very difficult to know, except for echolocating bats. These flying mammals perceive their surroundings by emitting loud and high-pitched biosonar calls and listening for the returning echoes. Because bat biosonar imaging is much sparser in information than vision, we can accurately measure the biosonar calls of interacting bats with a group of microphones and then calculate what each of the individuals perceived. When observing pairs of Daubenton's bats foraging low over water for stranded insects, we found they have intriguing `traffic rules' - they chase each other, perform tandem turns and even slow down to avoid collision. When we then modelled their biosonar view of the surroundings during these interactions we discovered that one simple trick suffices to create all their interactive behaviours: once another individual is close enough for your biosonar to pick up its echo, copy this individual's flight direction within 4-5 of your own wingbeats.<br>NOTE: Sensor type is 2D videogrammetry, not GPS.

Contrary to the control animals, the translocated mallards did not continue migration and stayed at Lake Constance.

A recent experiment on Atlantic shearwaters (Cory’s shearwater, Calonectris borealis) breeding in the Azores indicated a crucial role of olfaction over the open ocean, but left open the question of whether birds might navigate by topographical landmark cues when available. Our experiment was conducted in the Mediterranean sea, where the availability of topographical cues may provide an alternative navigational mechanism for homing. Magnetically disturbed shearwaters and control birds oriented homeward even when the coast was not visible and rapidly homed. Anosmic shearwaters oriented in a direction significantly different from the home direction when in open sea. After having approached a coastline their flight path changed from convoluted to homeward oriented, so that most of them eventually reached home.

Foraging areas used at stopovers in the Llanos de Moxos were remarkably limited, suggesting the importance of grazing lawns maintained by the geese and other herbivores, possibly including cattle.

Plasticity in movement strategies allows a species to better track spatial dynamics of habitat quality. We describe the mechanisms that shape the movement of a long-distance migrant bird (turkey vulture, Cathartes aura) across two continents using satellite tracking coupled with remote-sensing science. Using nearly 10 years of data from 24 satellite-tracked vultures in four distinct populations, we describe an enormous amount of variation in their movement patterns. We related vulture movement to environmental conditions and found important correlations explaining how far they need to move to find food (indexed by the normalized difference vegetation index) and how fast they can move based on the prevalence of thermals and temperature. We conclude that the extensive variability in the movement ecology of turkey vultures, facilitated by their energetically efficient thermal soaring, suggests that this species is likely to do well across periods of modest climate change. The large scale and sample sizes needed for such analysis in a widespread migrant emphasizes the need for integrated and collaborative efforts to obtain tracking data and for policies, tools and open datasets to encourage such collaborations and data sharing.\",\"research\",true,,,true,false\r\n\"Rimgaudas Treinys, Deivis Dementavičius, Valentinas Pabrinkis, Daiva Vaitkuvienė\",,\"Unpublished & ongoing study\",,,true,false,103999063,,,55.3,21.45,\"Birds of prey Lithuania GPS 2015\",,,,,,,\"Mindaugas Dagys & Ramūnas Žydelis\",\"Investigations of birds of prey in Lithuania using GPS telemetry have been initiated by Mindaugas Dagys and Ramūnas Žydelis in collaboration with Rimgaudas Treinys.

Activity over the season (September–April) was remarkably constant. Compared to the average activity per half-day, excess activity alternated every 12 h, suggesting an increased need for rest during daylight after a night with excess activity, and vice versa. Between days, activity was allocated to half-days in a very flexible manner: Either day or night activity was increased for a number of days, before increased activity gradually switched to the other half-day. We observed no synchrony in this pattern among individuals, highlighting the behavioural flexibility of this generalist species.\",\"research\",true,2009-03-23 14:00:00.000,2007-09-05 14:00:00.000,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,158298115,,,41.9816123553485,-2.33230592217296,\"Milvus milvus.

For more than 50 years, it has been hypothesized that, during autumn migration, blackpoll war- blers (Setophaga striata) depart northeastern North America and undertake a non-stop flight over the Atlantic Ocean to either the Greater Antilles or the northeastern coast of South America. Using miniaturized light-level geoloca- tors, we provide the first irrefutable evidence that the blackpoll warbler, a 12 g boreal forest songbird, completes an autumn transoceanic migration ranging from 2270 to 2770 km (mean + s.d.: 2540 + 257) and requiring up to 3 days (62 h + 10) of non-stop flight.

However, the energy costs of flying are considerably higher than those of resting. Therefore, when birds fly off after a disturbance, they use extra energy that subsequently needs to be compensated. We measured flight durations of the white-fronted goose, the most common (grass-eating) species wintering in western Europe, by high-frequency accelerometer recordings and made direct observations on these days to determine whether the flight durations were reliably recorded. Using both a simple and a more realistic model of the energy balance, we calculated the extra grass consumption resulting from additional intentional disturbances.\nOn average, the geese flew daily 2 × 323 s (from and to their roosting sites at 3200 m), and furthermore took to the air 5.3 times during a day (and 1.9 times a night). Multiplied with the average flight durations of 195 s, this gives a total flying time of almost 0.6 h day-1 and a total foraging time of 7.4 h day-1. With an intentional disturbance rate e.g. of five times a day, the birds’ compensation for the increased energy expenditure will lead to a higher overall consumption of grass of 11.5–16 % day-1. Accommodation schemes have to take such increases in total grass consumption into account when deciding on the refuge areas to be set aside.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"Max Planck Institute for Ornithology and local partners\",,,,,true,false,20873986,,,35.6037187406973,-79.1015625,\"LifeTrack Bald Eagle\",,,,,,,,\"Lifetime tracking of individuals.

This population of snow geese have traditionally used very discrete estuary and agricultural habitats associated with Skagit and Port Susan Bays.\n\nThe breeding grounds of this population are on Wrangel Island, Russia. Because Wrangel Island snow geese represent the last major snow goose population breeding in Asia, and the primary Russian goose population that winters in North America, it is a high priority for the Pacific Flyway and the subject of long standing international cooperative management and conservation. Data collected since the early 1970s on Wrangel Island indicates that the population has grown in abundance, become younger, and changed its behavior relative to traditional habitat and resources. These population changes have become more apparent since the early 1990s and appear to be in response to warmer spring conditions, earlier snowmelt, and changes in the predator community on Wrangel Island. Some of these changes are also evident in the NPS wintering population where the total overwintering population size has increased.\n\nThe objectives of this project are to examine the current relationship of the NPS population to other Pacific flyway use areas. This will include documentation of migration routes, phenology, staging areas, and stopover locations throughout the flyway. Particular questions that we hope to answer include: \n\n- When do geese depart and return to NPS during spring and fall migration?\n\n- Where are important flyway use areas during migration?\n\n- When and how long do geese use areas along migration routes?\n\n- Document inter and/or intra-year interchange among NPS and other wintering areas.\n\n- Do some geese that use NPS move to other locations within the flyway during the same winter or among different years?\n\n- If NPS geese are moving to other locations, what is the timing of emigration and potential return to NPS?\n\nThe transmitters are programed to transmit for three years.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,213390941,,,33.35431,-81.53039,\"RCCW Garabedian\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",true,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,166898539,,,39.4457380804475,-6.29722595214844,\"Iberian Imperial Eagle tracking in Extremadura\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Finch T, Saunders P, Avilés JM, Catry I, de la Puente J, Emmenegger T, Mardega I, Mayet P, Parejo D, Račinskis E, Rodríguez-Ruiz J, Sackl P, Schwartz T, Tiefenbach M, Valera F, Hewson C, Franco A, Butler SJ (2015) A pan-European, multi-population assessment of migratory connectivity in a near-threatened migrant bird.

Given recent declines of long-distance migrant birds, multi-population tracking studies are crucial in order to assess the strength of migratory connectivity and to identify key sites en route. Here, we present the first large-scale analysis of migration patterns and migratory connectivity in the globally near-threatened European roller Coracias garrulus.<br>\nLocation: Breeding area: Europe; passage area: Mediterranean, sub-Saharan Africa, Arabian Peninsula; wintering area: southern Africa<br>\nMethods: We synthesise new geolocator data with existing geolocator, satellite tag and ring recovery data from eight countries across Europe. We describe routes and stopover sites, analyse the spatial pattern of winter sites with respect to breeding origin, and quantify the strength of connectivity between breeding and winter sites.<br>\nResults: We demonstrate the importance of the northern savannah zone as a stopover region and reveal the easterly spring loop (via Arabia) and leap-frog migration of rollers from eastern populations. Whilst there was some overlap between individuals from different populations over winter, their distribution was non-random, with positive correlations between breeding and autumn/winter longitude as well as between pairwise distance matrices of breeding and winter sites. Connectivity was stronger for eastern populations than western ones.<br>\nMain conclusions: The moderate levels of connectivity detected here may increase the resilience of breeding populations to localised habitat loss on the winter quarters. We also highlight passage regions crucial for the successful conservation of Roller populations, including the Sahel/Sudan savannah for all populations, and the Horn of Africa/Arabian Peninsula for north-eastern rollers.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,188470881,,,33.104,35.611,\"ATLAS hula Acrocephalus stentoreus\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,168527870,,,39.7256729200321,-89.7603607177734,\"Franklin's Ground Squirrel pi fam. name Illinois\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"I thank Robert Leedy, USFWS and Dirk V.

We differentiated seven classes of land cover—alfalfa, annually rotated irrigated crops, developed, grassland, orchard / vineyard, rice, and water. From 2011–2013, we fitted transmitters with global positioning systems to 23 adult Swainson’s Hawks. We recorded a minimum of six locations per day per bird from spring through early autumn of each year. We used a fixed, bivariate-normal kernel estimator to calculate a utilization distribution at 30-m resolution for each life stage of each individual within each year. We used a linear mixed model to estimate the associations between intensity of space use and land cover, sex, and reproductive status. The majority of adult Swainson’s Hawks traveled distances up to 8–10 km from the nest throughout the breeding season. Median seasonal home-range sizes in a given year ranged from 87–172 km2. The association between intensity of space use and grassland was 50–139% stronger, and the association between intensity of space use and alfalfa 23–59% stronger, than the associations between intensity of space use and any other land-cover type. Intensity of space use did not vary as a function of sex, reproductive status, or life stage. Given our results and additional knowledge of the species’ ecology, we suggest that reproductive success and, in turn, population-level recruitment may be associated equally if not more closely with availability of nesting sites than with the current distribution of land cover.\n\nData fields are as follows.\nid: The unique identifier for the tracked individual.\ndatetime: The date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.

This study reports the near-real time monitoring of fine-scale behaviour of sunfish. The study was conducted in southern Portugal in May 2014 and involved satellite tags and underwater and surface robotic vehicles to measure both the movements and the contextual environment of the fish. A total of four individuals were tracked using custom-made GPS satellite tags providing geolocation estimates of fine-scale resolution. These accurate positions further informed sunfish areas of restricted search (ARS), which were directly correlated to steep thermal frontal zones. Simultaneously, and for two different occasions, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) video-recorded the path of the tracked fish and detected buoyant particles in the water column. Importantly, the densities of these particles were also directly correlated to steep thermal gradients. Thus, both sunfish foraging behaviour (ARS) and possibly prey densities, were found to be influenced\nby analogous environmental conditions. In addition, the dynamic structure of the water transited by\nthe tracked individuals was described by a Lagrangian modelling approach. The model informed the\ndistribution of zooplankton in the region, both horizontally and in the water column, and the resultant\nsimulated densities positively correlated with sunfish ARS behaviour estimator (r s = 0.184, p=0.001).\nThe model also revealed that tracked fish opportunistically displace with respect to subsurface current\nflow. Thus, we show how physical forcing and current structure provide a rationale for a predator’s\nfine-scale behaviour observed over a two weeks in May 2014.\",\"research\",true,,,true,false\r\n\"Thanks to Parks Canada for providing logistical support, as well as flights and longing on Sable Island\",,,,\"Funding was provided by NSERC to Dr. Phil Taylor. \",true,false,175460851,,,43.9205822654512,-60.018310546875,\"Departure dates and locations Ipswitch Sparrow Passerculus sandwichensis Nova Scotia, Canada.\",,,,,,,,\"Radio tracking data of Ipswich sparrows tagged during dispersal and fall migration from Sable Island \",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"WSCC and MPIO\",,,,\"WSCC and MPIO\",true,false,180525847,\"Please do not use any data without contacting the PI\",,47.8445010157488,106.636596671306,\"LifeTrack Mongolia raptors\",,,,,,,,\"Lifetime tracking of individuals.

Subsequently, they moved widely throughout portions of western and southcentral Alaska up to 750 km from their natal areas during fall and winter months. Transmitters of two birds (one male and one female) continued to send location data into their second year and allowed us to determine the location and timing of the flightless molt period for each bird. Overall, our data suggest that juvenile Common Mergansers range widely immediately after fledging, that second year males and females may differ in their movement patterns, and that these movements have implications for population genetic structure of this species.

Important stopover locations and molting and wintering areas in marine waters are unknown, as is basic information such as the timing to and from stopover locations, the stopover duration and the origin (breeding population) of individuals. This information is needed to model the potential effects of off-shore oil and gas development, economic development of coastal areas, and the potential effects of a warming arctic. We used satellite telemetry (PTTs) to characterize migration and to identify wintering and staging areas of eiders that nested in: (1) northern Alaska (coastal barrier islands in the western Beaufort Sea between -149.940° and -145.941°; (2) western Alaska at Cape Espenberg (66.50°, -163.50°); (3) western Alaska on the YKD (61.173°, -165.597°); and (4) the Aleutian Archipelago. Wintering and stop-over locations of the most northern nesting population were in the most northern polynya (1300-1600 km from the nesting area) that predictably remained open throughout the winter. Birds from Cape Espenberg wintered to the south in open waters (400-700 km from the nesting area) and used the same general areas as the birds from the western Beaufort Sea and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Birds from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta winter in waters offshore from the marking location to open waters on the Alaska Peninsula. Eiders marked in the Aleutian Archipelago did not leave the Archipelago. Additional information can be obtained from the authors.  \n\nData archived here are from deployments in 2000 to 2007, except for deployments from the Aleutian Archipelago (2004 and 2006).\n\nCommon eiders marked in the Aleutian Archipelago are archived in the Movebank Data Repository (DOI 10.5441/001/1.s528h83q).  \n\nArchived data of Pacific common eiders were used in the following publications:\n\nPetersen, MR.

We discovered weak migratory connectivity at the roost scale, and extensive, fine-scale mixing of birds in the Amazon from distant (>2000 km) breeding sites, with some individuals sharing the same roosting trees. Despite vast tracts of contiguous forest in this region, birds occupied a much more limited habitat, with most (56%) roosts occurring on small habitat islands that were strongly associated with water. Only 17% of these roosts were in current protected areas.

We tracked 35 individuals from two colonies using high frequency GPS-dataloggers over four consecutive breeding seasons. Contrary to expectations, kestrels relied heavily on thermal soaring when foraging, especially during periods of high solar radiation. This produced a circadian pattern in the kestrel flight strategy that led to a spatial segregation of foraging areas. Kestrels flapped towards foraging areas close to the colony when thermals were not available. However, as soon as thermals were formed, they soared on them towards foraging areas far from the colony, especially when they were surrounded by poor foraging habitats. This reduced the chick provisioning rate at the colony. Given that lesser kestrels have a preference for feeding on large insects, and considering the average distance they cover to capture them during foraging trips, to commute using flapping flight would result in a negative energy balance for the family group. Our results show that lesser kestrels prioritize saving energy when foraging, suggesting that kestrels are more energy than time-constrained during the breeding season.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,28774468,\"Do not use for any purpouse without contacting the study owners.\",,36.254339,-5.957711,\"(EBD) Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita), Andalusia\",,,,,,,,\"The Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita) is one of the world most threatened birds, listed as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List. The historical range of Geronticus eremita probably extended throughout North Africa and into the Middle East. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, the species has been known from two disjunct populations: a western population in Morocco currently estimated at 300 individuals, an eastern migratory population between Syria and Ethiopia (less than 5 individuals) and in Turkey where remain 180 semi-captive birds (“BirdLife International,” 2015).\nBetween 2004 and 2011 an experimental programme, “Proyecto Eremita”, was accomplished in La Janda (Cádiz, southwestern Spain), to evaluate the efficiency of different releasing techniques of ibises bred in captivity in European zoos (NBI EEP) aimed to establish sedentary populations in this area. The “Proyecto Eremita” was developed by  the regional government of Andalusia (Junta de Andalucía) in collaboration with ZooBotánico Jerez, Estación Biológica de Doñana (EBD-CSIC) and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). The success of that project encouraged its promoters to undertake the reintroduction program in Andalusia  since 2012.\n \nAs a result of the “Proyecto Eremita” and the reintroduction program, La Janda has currently a wild population of roughly 80 individuals where a small breeding colony was settled in Vejer de la Frontera (Cádiz) in 2008, reaching the 25 breeding pairs in 2014. Among the next challenges for the team involved are the assessment of population viability, as well as advance the knowledge of the ecology of this rare bird. To this end, from 2014 a GPS tracking of some adults and juvenile birds is being conducted to improve insights into the species' threats and other ecological requirements (Vázquez et al., 2015).\",\"research\",true,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,70565460,,,36.25,-5.85,\"(EBD) Osprey (Pandion halieaetus), Andalusia\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Part of the work carried out in the Doñana Natural Area was possible thank you to the equipment and facilities of the Doñana Biological Reserve (RBD) co-funded by the FEDER program (2007-2013) through the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain.\",,\"Do not use for any purpouse without contacting the study owners\",,,true,false,74824866,,,36.999196,-6.416533,\"(EBD) Spanish Imperial Eagle (Aquila adalberti), Andalusia\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"University of Liverpool / BTO\",,,,\"NERC/ LWEC\",true,false,25478437,,,49.7040828705423,-2.23381414893083,\"z2014 Northern Gannet - Alderney\",,,,,,,,\"GPS tagging of breeding Gannets\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"DIP and MPIO, Storchenhof and Uni Potsdam\",,\"Rotics et al. unpublished data\",,\"German-Israeli Project Cooperation\n(DIP) by German Science Foundation\",true,false,10449698,,,52.1739316925685,12.161865234375,\"HUJ MPIO White Stork GSM 2013\",,,,,,,,\"Movement ecology and lifetime tracking of White Storks across Eurasia\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Valentinas Pabrinkis, Lithuanian Ornithological Society, Daiva Vaitkuvienė\",,\"Unpublished & ongoing study by Ornitela\",,,true,false,146932094,,,55.3391,24.5531,\"Common Crane Lithuania GPS, 2015-2016\",,,,,,,\"Mindaugas Dagys & Ramūnas Žydelis\",\"Crane investigations in Lithuania using GPS telemetry have been initiated by Mindaugas Dagys and Ramūnas Žydelis.

Large fat reserves and low humidity, indicative of beneficial synoptic weather patterns, favored southward departure across the Gulf. Individuals detected in the YP departed with large fat reserves and later in the fall with profitable winds, and flight durations (mean = 22.4 h) were positively related to wind profit. Age was not related to departure behavior, arrival, or travel time. However, vireos negotiated the GOM differently than thrushes, including different departure decisions, lower probability of detection in the YP, and longer crossing times.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,37622065,,,43.8077742138738,15.7022094726562,\"Emberiza melanocephala Croatia\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",true,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Monti et al. in prep\",,\"1)Foundation Prince Albert II de Monaco and the Associazone Italiana della Fondation Prince Albert II\n2) Maremma Regional Park\n3) Parc naturel régional de Corse\n\",true,false,20039459,\"No use for any purpose without permission of the PI.\nthese data belong to and are shared among the following personas and institutes: Olivier Duriez (CNRS-CEFE, Montpellier, France), Flavio Monti & Andrea Sforzi (Parco Naturale de la Maremma, Grossetto, Italia), Jean-Marie Dominici (Parc naturel régional de Corse, Ajaccio, France), Rafel Triay Bagur (Institut Menorqui d'Estudis, Mao, Espana), Antoni Munoz Navarro (Grup Balear d'Ornitologia i Defensa de la Naturalesa, Palma de Mallorca, Espana))\",,43.6102281417864,3.878173828125,\"Osprey in Mediterranean (Corsica, Italy, Balearics)\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"Data are collected by Waldrappteam, Johannes Fritz and colleagues, in collaboration with the Max-Planck Institute of Ornithology and the University of Konstanz\",,\"Fritz et al. unpublished data\",,,true,false,18957668,\"Please do not use any of the data without contacting the PI.\",,42.4453494668003,11.2060546875,\"Bald Ibis Waldrappteam 2\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,39155681,,,0.0,0.0,\"Bald ibis fall migration 2014\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,199738069,,,40.3779361222241,-3.26019287109375,\"Aquila chrysaetos in Alcarria Madrileña (Spain)\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,\"Various grants acquired through the US Bureau of Land Management\",true,false,111727730,,,37.5489326106411,-112.593383789062,\"sagegrouse frey southernutah\",,,,,,,,\"Determining habitat use patterns of sage-grouse at the southern edge of their distribution, including their response to habitat treatments\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Wildlife Diversity Program\",,\"Booms, T.

In the Southern Ocean, there is an extensive fishery for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba that is projected to increase further. Comparing distribution and prey selection of fishing operations versus predators is needed to predict fishery-related impacts on krill-dependent predators. In this context, it is important to consider not only predators breeding near the fishing grounds but also the ones breeding far away and that disperse during the non-breeding season where they may interact with fisheries. In this study, we first quantified the overlap between the distribution of the Antarctic krill fisheries and the distribution of a krill dependent seabird, the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, during both the breeding and non-breeding season. We tracked birds from the world biggest Antarctic petrel colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land), located >1000 km from the main fishing areas, during three consecutive seasons. The overall spatial overlap between krill fisheries and Antarctic petrels was limited but varied greatly among and within years, and was high in some periods during the non-breeding season. In a second step, we described the length frequency distribution of Antarctic krill consumed by Antarctic petrels, and compared this with results from fisheries, as well as from diet studies in other krill predators. Krill taken by Antarctic petrels did not differ in size from that taken by trawls or from krill taken by most Antarctic krill predators. Selectivity for specific Antarctic krill stages seems generally low in Antarctic predators. Overall, our results show that competition between Antarctic petrels and krill fisheries is currently likely negligible.

This precludes researchers from identifying demographically discrete units for population management and understanding the scale of inference from field studies. Further, habitats and specific sites that may be particularly important for BAGO are difficult to identify, as this species is not well covered by surveys for most of its annual cycle and range.\n\nOur research addresses the following questions:\n\n1) What are the rates, and geographic scale, of inter-annual site fidelity by all sex and age classes at various stages of the annual cycle? \n\n2) Do birds from the same breeding site occur in discrete areas during winter, or     are they widely distributed, and vice versa? \n\n3) How do the answers to 1 and 2 above combine to indicate demographically distinct management units?\n4) Are there important habitats or specific sites that are used by a large proportion of marked birds, which would indicate their value for conservation?\n\nFrom 2006 to 2012, we deployed 267 satellite transmitters (PTTs) on BAGO at five sites in British Columbia, Alberta, and Alaska. \",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Research funded by the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet and the PIFSC.\",,,,,true,false,17444281,,,15.1145528719441,145.7666015625,\"Rough-toothed Dolphins - Marianas - PIFSC\",,,,,\"NOAA Fisheries\n1845 Wasp Blvd., Building 176\nHonolulu, HI 96818  \",\"erin.oleson@noaa.gov\",\"Erin Oleson\",\"The Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center's Cetacean Research Program has conducted small boat surveys within the Marianas since 2010 and began deploying satellite tags in 2013.

Our study determines multi-dimensional differentiation of two sympatric top-predators, long-legged buzzards (LLB) and short-toed eagles (STE), which recently became sympatric during their breeding season in the Judean Foothills, Israel. By combining information from comprehensive diet and movement analyses we found four dimensions of differentiation: (1) Geographic foraging area: LLB tended to forage relatively close to their nests (2.35 ± 0.62 km), while STE forage far from their nest (13.03 ± 2.20 km); (2) Foraging-habitat type: LLBs forage at low natural vegetation, avoiding cultivated fields, whereas STEs forage in cultivated fields, avoiding low natural vegetation; (3) Diurnal dynamics of foraging: LLBs are uniformly active during daytime, whereas STEs activity peaks in the early afternoon; and (4) Food-niche: while both species largely rely on reptiles (47.8% and 76.3% for LLB and STE, respectively), LLB had a more diverse diet and consumed significantly higher percentages of lizards, while STE consumed significantly higher percentages of snakes. Our results suggest that this multidimensional differentiation allows the spatial coexistence of these two dense populations in the study area.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"Research funded by the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet and the PIFSC.\",,,,,true,false,206134671,,,15.115,145.767,\"Pantropical Spotted Dolphins - Marianas - PIFSC\",,,,,,,,\"The Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center's Cetacean Research Program has conducted small boat surveys within the Marianas since 2010 and began deploying satellite tags in 2013.

Of the two extant groups of vertebrates that are capable of powered flight, birds are thought to fly more efficiently and faster than bats. However, fast-flying bat species that are adapted for flight in open airspace are similar in wing shape and appear to be similar in flight dynamics to fast-flying birds that exploit the same aerial niche. Here, we investigate flight behaviour in seven free-flying Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) and report that the maximum ground speeds achieved exceed speeds previously documented for any bat. Regional wind modelling indicates that bats adjusted flight speeds in response to winds by flying more slowly as wind support increased and flying faster when confronted with crosswinds, as demonstrated for insects, birds and other bats. Increased frequency of pauses in wing beats at faster speeds suggests that flap-gliding assists the bats’ rapid flight. Our results suggest that flight performance in bats has been underappreciated and that functional differences in the flight abilities of birds and bats require re-evaluation.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,\"Kochert, M.N., M.R.

We radio tracked migrants using the Argos satellite system. Our initial samples were 34 Swainson's Hawks from representative areas of their breeding range, and 61 Peregrine Falcons captured at nest sites across the North American boreal forest and low Arctic or on the migration routes along the mid-Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. The average distance of migration for Peregrines was 8,624 km southward, and 8,247 km northward. Peregrines travelled at an average rate of 172 km/d southward and 198 km/d going north. Peregrine Falcons used at least three broad, general routes south from the breeding areas, and individuals stopped migrating as far north as the U.S.A. mid-Atlantic coast and as far south as central Argentina. The radiomarked Peregrine Falcons used coastal routes, mid-continental routes, and water-crossing routes: the Davis Strait and Caribbean Sea. During northward migration, Peregrines migrating through at Padre Island, Texas diverged for destinations from central Alaska across the continent to central West Greenland. Swainson's Hawks migrated an average of about 13,504 km southward and 11,952 km northward, and travelled 188 km/d southward and 150 km/d northward. Swainson's Hawks converged in eastern Mexico on the Gulf of Mexico coast. Southward, these hawks followed a narrow, well-defined path through Central America, across the Andes Mountains in Columbia, and east of the Andes to central Argentina where they all spent the austral summer. Swainson's Hawks northward migration largely retraced their southward route.\",\"research\",false,1998-06-24 00:56:00.000,1995-07-29 00:00:00.000,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,5743302,\"Data not to be used without written permission\",,42.8679124839153,-109.857788085938,\"Pinedale Bald Eagles\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",true,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,217505653,,,43.2932003138528,5.361328125,\"Aquila fasciata - Parc National des Calanques\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Max Planck Institute for Ornithology\",,,true,false,21231406,\"Please contact the PIs before you use any of this data.

Changes in reporting rates from bird atlas surveys suggest declines of up to 60 % over the last 20 years (1987-1982 vs. 2007-2013) across South Africa. Worryingly, large protected areas were not immune to these declines. For instance reporting rates in Kruger National Park (KNP; ca. 20,000 km2), an area often considered a stronghold for Martial Eagles, recorded a 54 % decline in reporting rates. It is not clear what the major drivers of declines have been in South Africa, nor what is contributing to the declines in these large protected areas. In this study we investigate the ecology of Martial Eagles in KNP to improve our understanding of the threats they face and how these threats at various stages in their life cycle may be driving declines within protected areas where one would expect that the species should be well conserved. \",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,226534488,,,18.1536815535151,74.5724487304688,\"Domestic dogs Vanak India\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Pollonara E, Guilford T, Rossi M, Bingman VP, Gagliardo A (2017) Right hemisphere advantage in the development of route fidelity in homing pigeons.

However, the role of functional brain asymmetries in spatial behaviour in natural settings is still poorly investigated. We studied monocularly occluded homing pigeons, Columba livia, to investigate potential differences in the hemispheric control of navigational performance. We GPS-tracked monoc- ularly occluded and control binocular homing pigeons during seven group training releases and a final solitary release from each of two sites. The pigeons were then given one last release from each site after a phase shift of the light-dark cycle under binocular conditions, to distinguish compass-based orientation from landmark-based pilotage. Overall, pigeons homing with the left eye/right hemisphere (RH) dis- played a greater fidelity to the familiar space previously experienced than pigeons homing with the right eye/left hemisphere (LH). Another difference between the two monocular groups is that LH pigeons were more likely than RH pigeons to fly with other pigeons during the group training releases. The data support the hypothesis that the left eye/right hemisphere plays a more substantial role as pigeons develop fidelity to certain routes to home from familiar release sites, an enhanced fidelity that may be supported by superior memory for familiar landmarks.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,227553899,,,62.9489782072092,-81.9624023605138,\"Thick-billed murre Elliott Canada\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Pennsylvania Game Commission State Wildlife Grants, Hawk Mountain Sanctuary and its members and private donors, Audubon Pennsylvania, East Stroudsburg University, Millersville University\",,\"contact PI\",,\"State Wildlife Grants, Pennsylvania Game Commission; private donors\",true,false,28691134,\"No publication without permission.

Ancient\nMurrelets (Synthliboramphus antiquus), of which half of the world's population breeds\nin Haida Gwaii, BC, are especially susceptible to oiling during the period immediately\nafter departing from their breeding colonies, as their offspring are flightless for more\nthan a month, constraining their parents to remain with them. In 2014 we deployed\ngeolocator loggers on breeding Ancient Murrelets at four colonies, two on the east and\ntwo on the west coast of Haida Gwaii to investigate patterns of post-breeding dispersal\nand subsequent migratory movements. Birds from east coast colonies moved south\nand east after leaving their colonies, remaining in Queen Charlotte Sound and adjacent\nwaters for 4-6 weeks. Those from the west coast colonies moved north and west and\nmostly continued in the same direction, so that they left BC waters earlier than those\nfrom east coast colonies. This initial period of slow movement, presumably while chicks\nwere flightless, was consistent with being driven by surface currents. In June, with\nbrood-rearing apparently completed, all birds moved rapidly to the eastern Aleutians\nand SE Bering Sea, some continuing to waters off Kamchatka. Moult probably started\nsoon after this rapid migration phase. In August most birds moved north, some passing\nthrough Bering Straits where observations at sea show they are in basic plumage. In\nOctober-November the sample split into two groups, one returning to waters off\nwestern N America (33%) and the remainder carrying on westwards to waters off\nJapan, Korea and NE China. For the former group the movement to the Bering Sea in\nJune constitutes a moult migration and, as such, is the first described for an auk. The\nAsian-wintering birds started moving eastwards in February and arrived off BC in the\nsecond half of March, when observations at colonies show that burrow visits begin in\nHaida Gwaii. Our data suggest that during their most vulnerable phase, immediately\nafter colony departure, birds from the east coast colonies (about half the population of\nHaida Gwaii) are at higher risk than those breeding on the west coast from potential oil\nspills in northern British Columbia waters.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Ascension Island Government Conservation Department Team, University of Exeter (Dr Annette Broderick & Prof. Brendan Godley), RSPB and Dr Julia Sommerfield\n\",,,,\"RSPB core funding, Darwin Initiative Funding (Project: Implementing a Biodiversity Action Plan for Ascension Island), AIG core funding\",true,false,10604741,\"Data only to be used in collaboration with PIs and Ascension Island Government.

The success of either migratory strategy is the result of differential forage selection and predation risk-avoidance. In this dissertation, I examine how multi-scale resource selection by migrant and resident elk (Cervus elaphus) differentially influence demography. I studied the partially migratory Ya Ha Tinda elk population, which winters in the province of Alberta and migrates in summer to Banff National Park. I reviewed population trends from 1970–2005, and found the migrant proportion declined from 95% to 60%. To examine the role of differential forage selection, I built a spatially and temporally-explicit forage model using field and remote sensing data to predict available forage biomass and quality to elk. By selecting intermediate forage biomass in phenologically delayed areas, migrants had 5% higher forage digestibility than residents. Next, I developed a spatially and temporally explicit predation risk model for wolves (Canis lupus), elk’s main predator. Predation risk at the summer range scale was 70% lower for migrants compared to residents. Yet, despite riskier summer ranges, resident elk adopted fine-scale foraging and anti-predator strategies within these ranges to reduce the risk they experienced to only 15% higher than that of migrants. Furthermore, predation risk experienced by migrants during migratory periods was 52% higher than residents. Differences in resource selection translated to demographic differences between strategies in Leslie-matrix models. Bottom-up effects manifested in higher pregnancy rates and female calf weights for migrants. Yet top-down effects of predation by wolves and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) were greater for migrants, who experienced lower adult and calf survival. Resident adult and calf survival was higher despite poorer forage because of fine-scale risk-avoidance combined with a behavioural response to live in larger group sizes in summer. The ratio of migrant to resident population growth rates from Leslie-matrix models matched the observed rate of migratory decline from 1970-2005. I conclude that given current conditions, notwithstanding potential density-dependent processes, the proportion of migrants in this population will continue to decline as a result of top-down limitation despite the significant benefits of higher forage quality from migration.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,230083075,,,47.7638,105.879,\"Hustai National Park\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,230900284,,,41.6106442018284,-83.1231933832714,\"Black-crowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), Ohio\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,149548138,,,43.126421335093,-0.304269790649414,\"Egyptian vulture Kobierzycki Gardon \",,,,,,,,\"CRBPO #457                    Domaine Vital - 2 couples du Gardon\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,81273742,,,43.0789192998597,-0.42022705078125,\"Egyptian vulture Kobierzycki Pyrenees\",,,,,,,,\"CRBPO #457                     Oiseau relâché en 2015 centre de soins \",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,198213960,,,43.6378972773605,4.81132507324219,\"Egyptian vulture Kobierzycki Vaucluse\",,,,,,,,\"CRBPO #457                    Oiseau relâché Centre soins Buoux Cécile Ponchon \",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,231392122,,,32.4019761995955,34.8664963245392,\"Israel's sea turtle monitoring program\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Ademar Ribeiro Romeiro, Paulo Nogueira-Neto, Peter Crawshaw, Rogerio Cunha de Paula and Ronaldo Morato\",,\"ICOON - Instituto Corredor das Onças\",,\"Ministry of the Environment (MMA/Brasil), GIZ, KfW Entwicklungsbank, United Nations Brazil (ANUBRA), FMC Corporation and Puma Corridor Institute (ICOON)\",true,false,201943221,,,-22.6238352542953,-47.135124206543,\"Puma Corridor\",,,,,,,,\"The Puma Corridor is a biodiversity conservation project aimed at improving the quality and quantity of the water in the region of the city of Campinas, in the east of São Paulo state, Brazil.

The production of quality water, on the other hand, will foster the increase and improvement of the forested area, as well as the conditions for a more efficient and sustainable management of the soil for agricultural purposes. \nThe puma (Puma concolor) is a flagship species for the development of the ecological corridor. Its presence was confirmed during the first field surveys conducted in the project, and it confirms the adaptation of this large predator to an environment that few would classify as favorable. The area consists of small fragments of remaining natural forest immersed in a matrix of sugarcane plantations and pastures, in a highly industrialized and urbanized landscape.  One of the important aspects of the puma, as a top predator, is its capacity to control prey species included in its diet.

If extensive pollinator movement is part of their normal routine, it could allow plants the bees pollinate to be rare and occur in widely scattered locations. However the absence of movement data from solitary bees presents a formidable challenge to quantitative prediction. Here we use micro radio telemetry to show that individual male orchid bees (Exaerete frontalis) habitually use large areas (at least 42 – 115 ha) on a daily basis. Aerial telemetry located individuals up to 5 km away from core ranges. When following individual bees we found them to be stationary for variable lengths of time and then fly to a new site where again they remained stationary. In addition our data suggest a bimodal frequency distribution of home range sizes. We propose individuals either use multiple widely-separated core areas or have a central core with an extremely large periphery where they gather resources. We suggest that the large distances habitually travelled by the orchid bees have important implications for explaining orchid diversity and plant evolution.\",\"research\",false,2007-03-11 01:30:00.000,2007-03-02 16:00:00.000,true,false\r\n,,\"Lafferty DJR, Belant JL, Phillips DL (2015) Testing the niche variation hypothesis with a measure of body condition.

It is considered rare, and it is reported on several regional conservation lists of species as either endangered or data deficient. Given its uniqueness and the poor knowledge of its ecology, we aimed to investigate home range size and overlap and habitat selection of the water opossum in Atlantic Forest streams in southeastern Brazil. We radio tracked water opossums and collected information about their habitats and behaviour from October 2004 to April 2010. We combined common home range estimators for animals living in linear habitats with the synoptic model of home range and habitat selection. For the 10 individuals monitored, the home ranges varied between 0.80 and 9.66 km of watercourses; none of them had exclusive home ranges. The home range size for males was, on average, three times larger than for females. The overlap data showed that, on average, one male could encompass the home ranges of up to five females simultaneously, but more than one male could have access to the same female. For habitat selection at the individual level, we could not find any strong influence of habitat features on water opossum preferences because individuals selected different sets of habitat variables. However, at the population level, we found a negative relationship between home range size and river size. The water opossum seems to prefer shallow and narrow watercourses to establish its home ranges. Here, we present valuable information to advance our knowledge of the water opossum and its ecology, which is urgent for conservation purposes.\",\"research\",true,,,true,false\r\n,,\"Kölzsch A, Müskens GJDM, Kruckenberg H, Glazov P, Weinzierl R, Nolet BA, Wikelski M (2016) Towards a new understanding of migration timing: slower spring than autumn migration in geese reflects different decision rules for stopover use and departure.

Competition for the best breeding sites is supposed to be the main driver, but timing of migration is often also influenced by environmental factors such as food availability and wind conditions. Using GPS tags, we tracked 65 greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons migrating between western Europe and the Russian Arctic during spring and autumn migration over six different years. Contrary to theory, our birds took considerably longer for spring migration (83 days) than autumn migration (42 days). This difference in duration was mainly determined by time spent at stopovers. Timing and space use during migration suggest that the birds were using different strategies in the two seasons: In spring they spread out in a wide front to acquire extra energy stores in many successive stopover sites (to fuel capital breeding), which is in accordance with previous results that white-fronted geese follow the green wave of spring growth. In autumn they filled up their stores close to the breeding grounds and waited for supportive wind conditions to quickly move to their wintering grounds. Selection for supportive winds was stronger in autumn, when general wind conditions were less favourable than in spring, leading to similar flight speeds in the two seasons. In combination with less stopover time in autumn this led to faster autumn than spring migration. White-fronted geese thus differ from theory that spring migration is faster than autumn migration. We expect our findings of different decision rules between the two migratory seasons to apply more generally, in particular in large birds in which capital breeding is common, and in birds that meet other environmental conditions along their migration route in autumn than in spring.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,\"Rotics S, Kaatz M, Resheff YS, Turjeman SF, Zurell D, Sapir N, Eggers U, Flack A, Fiedler W, Jeltsch F, Wikelski M, Nathan R (2016) The challenges of the first migration: movement and behavior of juvenile versus adult white storks with insights regarding juvenile mortality.

We compared juvenile and adult parameters of movement, behavior and energy expenditure (estimated from overall dynamic body acceleration, ODBA) and placed this in the context of the juveniles’ lower survival rate. Juveniles used flapping flight versus soaring flight 23% more than adults and were estimated to expend 14% more energy during flight. Juveniles did not compensate for increased flight costs by increased refueling or resting during migration. When juveniles and adults migrated together in the same flock, the juvenile flew mostly behind the adult and was left behind when they separated. Juveniles showed greater improvement in flight efficiency throughout migration compared to adults which appears crucial because juveniles exhibiting higher flight costs suffered increased mortality.\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Bastille-Rousseau G, Yackulic CB, Frair JL, Cabrera F, Blake S (2016) Allometric and temporal scaling of movement characteristics in Galapagos tortoises.

We investigated how the temporal scaling of allometric patterns in movement vary over the course of a year, specifically during periods of motivated (directional and fast movement) and unmotivated (stationary and tortuous movement) behaviour and used state-space modelling to estimate seven different movement metrics of Galapagos tortoises. Allometric scaling of movement was more apparent during motivated periods of movement. During this period, allometry was revealed at multiple temporal intervals (hourly, daily, and monthly), with values observed at daily and monthly intervals corresponding most closely to the expected 1⁄4 scaling coefficient, albeit with wide credible intervals. We further detected differences in the magnitude of scaling among taxa uncoupled from observed differences in the temporal structuring of their movement rates. Our results indicate that the definition of temporal scales is fundamental to the detection of allometry of movement, and should be given more attention in movement studies.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,\"Gagliardo A, Pollonara E, Wikelski M (2016) Pigeon navigation: exposure to environmental odours prior to release is sufficient for homeward orientation, but not for homing.

We observed that pigeons transported and kept at the release site in purified air and made anosmic at the release site were unable to orient towards home and were impaired at homing. By contrast, pigeons allowed to smell environmental odours during transportation and at the release site, although made anosmic prior to release, displayed unimpaired homeward orientation, but nevertheless showed impaired homing performance. These results are consistent with the view that local odour at the release site are critical for determining the direction of displacement (olfactory map) and suggest that pigeons consult the olfactory map also during their homing flight in order to be able to find their way home.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n\"We thank Dr. Parry Clark who collected the baboon spatial data and Cape Nature who gave permission for the research.\",,\"Bonnell TR, Henzi SP, Barrett L (2016) Direction matching for sparse movement datasets: determining interaction rules in social groups.

To create the necessary lift to support the same weight and maintain soaring flight in thin air birds might modify lift coefficient by biophysical changes, such as wing posture and increasing the power expenditure. Alternatively, they can change their flight characteristics. We show that vultures use the latter and increase circle radius by 35% and airspeed by 21% over their flight altitude range. These simple behavioural adjustments enable vultures to move seamlessly during their annual migrations over the Himalaya without increasing energy output to flight in high elevations.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,179532874,\"No use for any purpose without written permission from Jerry Belant (j.belant@msstate.edu)\",,46.2363776412469,-88.2401275634766,\"Michigan Predator-Prey Study - Phase 2\",,,,,,,,\"GPS movement of Canis lupus sp., Ursus americanus, Lynx rufus, and Canis latrans. 15 min. relocations\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Canadian Wildlife Service\nThe Center for Conservation Biology\",,\"Smith, F.M. and B.D.Watts. 2017.

As a consequence of the links between biomes mediated by migrants, changes in one biome could affect remote areas in unpredictable ways. Migratory routes and timing of most Neotropical austral migrants, which breed at south temperate latitudes of South America and overwinter closer to or within tropical latitudes of South America, have yet to be described in detail. As a result, our understanding about how these birds provide links between South American biomes is almost non-existent. White-crested Elaenia (Elaenia albiceps chilensis) is a long-distance austral migrant that breeds in the Patagonian Forest biome and overwinters in tropical South America. Because this small flycatcher plays a key role in the regeneration of this ecosystem, our objective was to describe the annual cycle of White-crested elaenias to evaluate the degree of migratory connectivity between breeding and wintering areas and therefore to determine if there are specific biomes of northern South America linked by elaenias to Patagonian forests. Fifteen individuals were successfully tracked throughout a complete migration cycle using miniature light-level geolocators. All individuals resided and moved through the same general regions. During fall (March-April-May), elaenias were located in the Caatinga and the Atlantic Forest biomes, from Rio de Janeiro to the region near Salvador da Bahia, Brazil. During winter (June-July-Aug), birds were located further inland, within the Cerrado biome. Birds used three different routes during fall migration. Our results indicate that some individuals use a direct route, flying between 500-600 km/day, crossing desert and grasslands, while others took a detour, flying 100-200 km/day through forested areas with refueling opportunities. All birds used the Yunga forest during spring migration, with ten out 15 individuals showing a clear counterclockwise loop trajectories throughout their annual cycle. None of the elaenias passed through Amazonia, traveled to western South America or crossed the Equator. Eleanias exhibited a high migratory connectivity between breeding area in Patagonian Forests and winter areas, Atlantic Forest and Cerrado. Our results suggest that Patagonian Forests could be strongly impacted by changes in those biomes or in the Yungas.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,236738051,,,-1.40906910064254,38.0273294448853,\"African riparian birds Kenya\",,,,,,,,\"Trait-based avian movement ecology to measure ecosystem health of East African riparian ecosystems\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Moßbrucker, A.

However, the difficulty of tracking small birds between breeding and wintering areas has hindered progress in this area. To learn more about Kirtland’s Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) movement patterns throughout the annual cycle, we deployed archival light-level geolocators across the breeding range in Michigan. We recovered devices from 27 males and analyzed light-level data within a Bayesian framework. We found that most males wintered in the central Bahamas and exhibited a loop migration pattern. In both fall and spring, departure date was the strongest predictor of arrival date, though in spring, stopover duration and migration distance were also important. Though stopover strategies varied, males spent the majority of their spring migration at stopover sites, several of which were located just before or after large ecological barriers. We argue that loop migration is likely a response to seasonal variation in prevailing winds. By documenting a tight link between spring departure and arrival dates, we provide a plausible mechanism for previously documented carry-over effects of winter rainfall on reproductive success in this species. The migratory periods remain the least understood periods for all birds, but by describing Kirtland’s Warbler migration routes and timing, and identifying locations of stopover sites, we have begun the process of better understanding the dynamics of their full annual cycle. Moreover, we have provided managers with valuable information on which to base future conservation and research priorities.\",\"research\",false,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,236291731,,,71.2355223477972,-155.6982421875,\"Black Guillemot Cepphus grylle Cooper Island, Alaska\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,236779788,,,41.4654988126486,-83.001708984375,\"taxon com. name pi fam. name study loc.\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,237059428,,,,,\"dracodoc\",,,,,,,,,\"administration\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,\"Duck data Max Planck Institute for Ornithology\",,,true,false,236953686,\"Data may not be used without prior contacting the PI\",,47.7668118874374,8.99528267851565,\"LifeTrack Ducks Lake Constance 2017\",,,,,,,,\"study of migration flyways of ducks\",\"research\",true,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,237829028,,,30.7512777762578,126.843745708466,\"B.ind. spr_100k_Feb6\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"xxx\",,\"xxx\",,\"xxx\",true,false,237935814,,,38.1403438853989,15.8019681181759,\"TEST Radar\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"xxx\",,\"xxx\",,\"xxx\",true,false,238187845,,,54.4961294224599,11.2242976482958,\"TEST Radar Fehmarn\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,42451582,,,43.7656239103642,-116.647140598507,\"Long-billed Curlew Migration from Idaho\",,,,,,\"jaycarlisle@boisestate.edu\",\"Jay Carlisle\",,\"research\",true,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,237948244,,,36.0313317763319,-75.9375,\"2-weeks-BOEM\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"xxx\",,\"xxx\",,\"xxx\",true,false,238198625,,,38.2191266841527,15.6351386464667,\"TEST Radar Strait Messina 2006\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,238215333,,,-25.3813604360038,33.75,\"cape vulture dana lutfor africa.\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"xxx\",,\"xxx\",,\"xxx\",true,false,238234482,,,38.2398455627945,15.8473735529697,\"TEST Radar Strait Messina Apennines 2015-2016\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,238256215,,,-24.1042380441193,32.34375,\"cape vul dana 4811 study loc.\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,238271943,,,-24.7444343576663,34.453125,\"4812\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,238295395,,,-24.1042478374431,33.046875,\"cape vulture_dana_lutfor\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,238349614,,,43.464,-65.748,\"Blackpoll Warbler MOTUS\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,239069888,,,22.4199152273486,-89.7150421142578,\"Oceanographic habitat use of masked boobies in the Gulf of Mexico\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,238730898,,,8.9284870626655,-1.318359375,\"Eidolon_TEST\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,,true,false,152496827,,,46.984,-119.3111,\"Caspian Terns, Columbia Plateau, WA, 2016\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",true,,,true,false\r\n,,,,,true,false,239170772,,,31.952162238025,131.062495708466,\"uniform_0.02\",,,,,,,,,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,\"Daejeon City\",true,false,239271615,,,36.3502504907668,127.404327392578,\"Grey Heron Lee Korea\",,,,,,,,\"Migration of Grey Heron\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,\"Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency of Korea\",true,false,238899361,,,36.954281585676,129.416198730469,\"Herring Gull Lee Korea\",,,,,,,,\"Migration of Herring Gulls in East Asia\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n,,,,\"Daejeon City\",true,false,239275727,,,36.3436138442893,127.402610778809,\"Great Egret Lee Korea\",,,,,,,,\"Migration of Great Egret\",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Franz from e-obs, Stephen Blake from the Galapagos tortoise movement study \",,,,,true,false,5826799,,,-9.39148405177488,46.2050628662109,\"Aldabra Giant Tortoise Long Term Study\",,,,,\"http://www.ieu.uzh.ch/research/zarp.html\",,\"Rich Baxter, Erik Postma, Lindsay Turnbull, Dennis Hansen, Gabriela Schaepman-Strub\",,\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Ph.d student\",,\"Israeli\",,,true,false,239376917,,,31.324533525367,34.7386837005615,\"taxon com. name pi fam. name study loc.\",,,,,,,,\"Landfills all over the world attract birds, acting as a food source. Sites in close proximity to airports, attract birds which constitute serious hazards to aircraft and their crew. In Israel, among the most prevalent species visiting landfills is the Black Kite (Milvus migrans). \nThe Black Kite is a medium-sized raptor that migrates through Israel during the spring and autumn, and winters in large numbers throughout the country. Their population in Israel has increased from several thousand during the 90’s to present numbers of more than 30,000 in the northern Negev alone. The Ganei-Hadas and Dudaim Waste Facility located 10 km from the Israeli Air Force (IAF) Hatzerim Air Base attracts the highest number of birds. Besides feeding at the landfills, the Black Kites also feed in open fields and inside the air base. The landfill proximity to the air base causes constant conflicts between the Black Kites and air base aircraft.  Several collisions every year leading to damage of tens of thousands of dollars. Additionally, the presence of the kites within the base's airspace negatively impacts the bases operational competence, and impedes important training flights. \nMy research goals are: 1. To use high-tech methods to track and analyses movement patterns of Black Kites; 2. Conduct food source manipulation experiments at the landfill, assessing this influence on Black Kites movement and behavior 3. Incorporate information on Black Kite movement patterns with remote detection methods to mitigate Black Kite and aircraft collisions at Hatzerim, as well as other air bases.  This represents the first study to assess wintering raptor populations, and the factors influencing their movement in Israel. This will be achieved through monitoring individuals using GPS tags, and monitoring Black Kites populations using Multi-Mission Hemispheric Radar and cameras. \n \n \",\"research\",false,,,false,true\r\n\"Association BECOT - Groupe d'Etude des rapaces du sud du Massif central\",,\"Spatial movements on adults and young golden eagles\",,\"Do not use for any purpose without contacting study owner\",true,false,137262099,,,43.6544595339215,3.04389953613281,\"Aquila Chrysaetos Golden Eagle France\",,,,,,,,\"We study the spatial movements on golden eagles in the south of the Massif central in France.
